Source Changes
--------------
Changed XML output so that BIOS sets, ROM sets, and disks are output
in the defined order. [MadSkunk]

Fixed a couple of bugs in the new screenshot taking code.
[Nathan Woods]

Improved memory map and clock speeds for the MPU4 driver. [El Condor]

Moved clipping into the core, rather than relying on the OSD layer to
do the work. Removed the PUSH_CLIP and POP_CLIP primitives as they
are no longer necessary. Added U/V coordinates to the primitives.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed the rendering order so that overlays mixed with backdrops work
as expected. Note that over-rendering backdrop pieces (like gollygho
does) may not be supported in the future. [Aaron Giles]

Changed DirectDraw behavior so that it will render to an offscreen
system memory buffer if any blending is required, thus providing
access to all the effects with a bit of slowdown in those cases.
[Aaron Giles]

Added a new command line option: -effect <filename>, which specifies
a PNG file that is loaded and used as an RGB multiply overlay. This
allows for scanline and RGB aperture mask effects. These overlays
rotate with the game screens and only affect the game screens, not
any of the other artwork. They also only run at the raw resolution
of the render_target. This means in Direct3D or GDI modes, they
map 1:1 to the pixels on your screen. In DirectDraw mode, they map
1:1 to the source pixels of the image (for DirectDraw, you can use
-prescale n if you want an n:1 mapping; for example, you would
probably want -prescale 2 if using a 2-pixel-tall scanlines overlay).
[Aaron Giles]

Added brightness, contrast, and gamma controls per-screen in the
on-screen display section of the UI. This requires a change to the
OSD rendering code to use lookup tables when copying RGB data to
textures. Default values can be specified via the -brightness,
-contrast, and -gamma command line/configuration options. Note that
these options only affect screen areas of the final output and have
no effect on artwork or the UI. The values configured in the OSD are
saved in the config file for each game. [Aaron Giles]

Added full screen equivalents of the brightness, contrast, and gamma
controls. Unlike the screens-specific options, these only work in
full screen mode using DirectX, and apply globally, affecting 
artwork and user interface as well. They are controlled via the
-full_screen_brightness, -full_screen_contrast, and 
-full_screen_gamma options. [Aaron Giles]

Added generic pen changing notification callbacks to the palette
system. [Aaron Giles]

Removed vector intensity controls as they are redundant with the new
contrast controls. [Aaron Giles]

Added X and Y offset/scale controls for each screen. This allows you
to control the actual position of the screen within its container. In
order to see beyond the game-configured visible area, the game must
have set up the screen size to be larger than the core visible area.
The Williams drivers have been updated as an example. Eugene Jarvis
mentioned that if you adjust your monitor, you can see the stack in
Robotron off to the right, and now you can in MAME as well. The values 
configured in the OSD are saved in the config file for each game.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed logic so that no rendering apart from the UI happens before
MAME is in a running state. Until that time, a single pixel border
will be displayed around the edges of each screen. [Aaron Giles]

Added option_get_int_range() and option_get_float_range() functions
which do added range checking on parameters, rather than requiring 
the callers to do the work. Also changed the behavior on options
parsing failure to set to the default value rather than defaulting
to 0. [Aaron Giles]

Changed behavior of secondary windows so that they are not created
as children of the primary window. Please re-verify that multiple
screens still work with this change on your setup. [Aaron Giles]

Added new video option to move the user interface to secondary 
screens. The selected screen is saved in the video configuration.
