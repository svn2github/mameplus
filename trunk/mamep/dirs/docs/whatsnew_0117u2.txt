Source Changes
--------------
Imola GP updates: [Phil Stroffolino]
 - renamed from "monzagp"
 - the leds are fully mapped
 - fixes for blitter modes, that affect the "tunnel" area
 - dipswitch/port fixes; game now starts in attract mode, rather 
    than immediately starting
 - placeholder (handpicked) colors

Updated DIP switches for topland & ainferno according to their 
manuals. [Fabio Priuli]

More SH-4 core improvements: [Samuele Zannoli]
 - fixes some problems in the disassembly and instruction execution 
    from the previous patch
 - adds interrupt management
 - implements register bank switching
 - adds RTC timer counters
 - adds memory refresh timer
 - adds three timers of the TMU
 - adds a configuration structure that specifies the processor mode 
    pin settings
 - internal processor clock frequencies calculated from mode pins and 
    cpu clock
 - systems using the sh4 processor secify its configuration structure

Fixed some DIP switches in littlerb. [Sonikos]

Made some minor code quality changes across the code: [Atari Ace]
 - avoided exporting a few global variables
 - fixed variable names that conflicted with typedef names
 - removed some shadow variables that were bugs or unnecessary
 - removed extraneous #defines

Fixed up sc61860 core, f3853 core, and pckeybd.c to work with new
timing code. [Nathan Woods]

More TIA improvements: [Wilbert Pol]
 - fixed some minor missile graphics positioning issues
 - moved some initialization code from tia_init to tia_reset

Fixed a few errors related to headers in the source code. Added 
missing self-includes, removed dead prototypes, and added location 
comments in headers in mame/includes. In a few cases the audit 
showed items that didn't need to be exported so they were made 
static. [Atari Ace]

Cleaned up the inputs in gdrawpkr and changed the hold buttons to 
"discard" since they are in fact discard buttons. [Roberto Fresca]

Added support for 14- and 16-segment LED displays to the MAME 
artwork system. [Dirk Best]

Fixed button 4 of player 2 inputs in bloodwar. [Barry Harris]

Connected S14001A speech to the wolfpack driver. [Lord Nightmare]

Fixed incorrect implementation of SSIO volume controls in the MCR
driver. This makes the engine sound in Spy Hunter audible again,
among other things. [Ernesto Corvi]

Added support back for the "none" option for the various *_device
options. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed HD6309 dissaembly of the post-byte for ,W++ and ,--W.
[Captain Ahab]

Updated the 6532 riot interface to be more like the 6522via and 
6821pia interfaces. [Wilbert Pol]

Improved -listxml output to reflect new BIOS flag. New attribute
isbios="yes" indicates that a given game is a BIOS. [Aaron Giles]

Further tweaks to the game selection UI: [Aaron Giles]
 - disabled the tab key
 - added hook for general input configuration from the menu
 - split set names from friendly names into left/right columns
 - added a background to the descriptive names of clones
 - if you start with the game selection menu, hitting Esc to exit
    a game brings you back to the menu rather than quitting 
    immediately
 - fixed logic so that INI files are reloaded for each game

Moved INI file handling fully into the core. As a side-effect of this 
change, <exename>.ini is no longer parsed. Changed -createconfig to 
always output mame.ini instead of <exename>.ini as a result. 
[Aaron Giles]
    
Renamed run_game() to mame_execute(). The game driver is no longer
specified as a parameter; rather, this information is extracted from
the options via OPTION_GAMENAME. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed raw input-based lightgun buttons. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up options.c code. Added priority levels to options as they
are set. New options are only accepted if they have greater or equal
priority to a previous change. Added new function options_revert() to
revert options below a given priority to their defaults. Changed 
options_get_string() so that it always returns a valid string
(never NULL). Invalid strings are returned as empty strings. 
[Aaron Giles]

Added new functions core_filename_extract_base() and 
core_filename_ends_with() to corefile.h. [Aaron Giles]

Changed menu rendering a bit. Added a background hilight to more
strongly emphasize the current item. Added rendered arrows to indicate
more items on the top/bottom and to indicate selection options in the
DIP switch menus. Changed hilighting to be a bit less garish. Fixed
repeat rates on keys to no longer be tied to the framerate.
[Aaron Giles]

Added support for page up/page down generically in menus. Also made
pause toggle work while menus are visible. [Aaron Giles]

Changed render_textures to allocate in a pool model, to avoid high
memory overhead when allocating large numbers of textures (for example
in the 14- and 16-segment LED displays). [Aaron Giles]

Fixed a number of 64-bit compiler warnings. [Aaron Giles]
