Source Changes
--------------
Cleaned up the freekick.c driver [Sonikos]:
 - added 2nd button in gigas/gias2m/oigas
 - matched the Z80 chip mhz to the "confirmed" mhz of gigas

Extended the gfxlayout structure to support "extended" arrays of
x and y offsets. These are used for layouts that are larger than
32x32. This enables the standard structure to be smaller for the
vast majority of games that don't require huge graphics decodes.
The end result is that the MAME .exe is ~3MB smaller.
[Atari Ace, Aaron Giles]

Added some Amiga enhancements needed for MESS Amiga and CDTV 
drivers. [Dirk Best]

Removed non-existant 3rd & 4th player controls from deadconx.
[Don Maeby]

Improvements to the MACS driver: [Tomasz Slanina]
 - fixed a couple of gfx bugs in st0016 video emulation
 - added hacks to allow MACS games to boot
 - removed REGION_DISPOSE flag from srmp5 and speaglsht (no more 
    crashes)

Fixed/improved DIP switches in the powerbal.c, konamigx.c, and 
gsword.c drivers. [Twisty]

More improvements to the BFM driver and the 6840 timer emulation.
[El Condor]

Improvements to the x86 drc engine and the Windows blitters:
 - Blitter CPUID features now accessed by drc_x86_get_features() call
 - Added win_blit_init(), to initialize the blitter
 - Changes to DRC to support usage for things other than CPU cores
 - Fixed drc_dasm() so it works once again
 - Added macros for a number of MMX/SSE instructions
 - Added a number of MMX/SSE instructions to the i386 disassembler

Actually applied the Marine Date fixes which were mentioned in a
previous u release. [Aaron Giles]

Added experimental support for building using Visual C++ 2003/2005.
To do this, you still need the mingw environment (ironically) because
we rely on the mingw make system to call out to the MSVC compilers.
Set the variable MSVC_BUILD=1 on the command line or by modifying
windows.mak, and it will build using the Microsoft compilers. This
works through the use of a stub program vconv.exe which translates
gcc options into MSVC options. As a bootstrapping measure, vconv.exe
is compiled at the start of a clean build by mingw. Most of the
standard build options just work (SYMBOLS, MAP, DEBUG, etc). If you
have a beefy computer, you can also set MAXOPT=1 and use link-time
code generation for maximum optimization effect. :) [Aaron Giles]

Added preliminary support for 64-bit targets. A new makefile define
PTR64 should be set if you are compiling for a 64-bit target. This
propogates a PTR64 define into the C files as well. Made the makefile
smart enough to auto-disable the drc cores for 64-bit, and removed
most of the roadblocks to a 64-bit build, apart from the assembly
blitters, which are currently undergoing a rewrite. [Aaron Giles]
