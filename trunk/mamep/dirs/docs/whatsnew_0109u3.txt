Source Changes
--------------
Added missing InitCommonControls(), which caused the debugger UI
to fail with recent updates. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed dip switches and added second player controls for beaminv
driver. [stephh]

Major rewrite of the SHARC core: [Ville Linde]
 - Bit-accurate reciprocals
 - More accurate pipeline emulation
 - Fixed the problems with operation latencies
 - Regression tested a few floating-point operations for bit-accurate 
    results
 - Improved DMA emulation
This update will fix most (but not all) of the clipping problems in 
Gradius 4 and NBA Play by Play.

Updated cardline driver lamps and layout: [wolf676]
 - converted hardcoded fake lamps to new artwork system
 - added button lamps card1-5, collect, bet, start

 - re-ordered buttons and added "collect" button

Updated funworld driver lamps and layout: [wolf676]
 - added external credit in counter (mapped as coin 1 counter)
 - added external credit out counter (mapped as coin 8 counter)

Added COP420 core for the Altair games. [Curt Coder]

Increased the interleave in Xevious to fix synchronization issues.
[robiza]

Added new output control system. This system is designed to support
multiple output streams, and should replace all instances of printf
in the code. You can now call one of these functions:

  mame_printf_error
  mame_printf_warning
  mame_printf_info
  mame_printf_debug

to output data. By default, these go to the console, but they can be
overridden by the OSD layer to route wherever is appropriate.
[Aaron Giles]

Some additional Grand Champion cleanup. [Aaron Giles]



New games added or promoted from NOT_WORKING status
