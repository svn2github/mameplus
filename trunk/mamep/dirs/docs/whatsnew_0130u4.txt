Source Changes
--------------
Documented the www.segaresurrection.com decrypted Ninja Kids II sound 
rom so it doesn't show up as newly "found" bootleg version.
[Brian Troha]

Converted downtown, gondo, hbarrel, midres, timesold, topgunbl to use 
IPT_POSITIONAL. [Derrick Renaud]

Fixed Analog Settings to return to default when IPT_UI_SELECT (enter) 
pressed. Fixed misplaced brackets, allowing upper/lower case 
extensions for crosshair graphics and ldplayer chd files. 
[Derrick Renaud]

Naomi updates: [Angelo Salese, David Haywood]
 * Added H-Blank IN interrupt hook-up
 * Generate a few more interrupts (ISP end of render, VIDEO end of 
    render)
 * Some minor improvements to the irq system
 * Added a bunch of Maple-DMA fixes, now moeru boots too

Factored out MESS-specific code from machine/atari.c (cart init, 
loading & unloading) [Fabio Priuli]

Correctly implemented 'trail' function in ninjakd2. [kanikani]

Changed galgbios service switch to be a toggle. [David Haywood]

Fixed CPU_GET_INFO issues spotted by -validate in MESS debug build.
[Fabio Priuli]

Added Dip Locations to jalmah.c. [Fabio Priuli]

Improved test mode behaviour on the jalmah.c. [Angelo Salese]

Added display of frame number to the beamx/y info in the register 
view in the debugger. [Aaron Giles]

munch mobile improvements: [robiza]
 * implemented priorities
 * removed unnecessary tile index check

Memory map merging for naughtyb.c, ssrj.c. [Angelo Salese]

Converted jangou & nightgal drivers to use resistors with the color 
proms. [Angelo Salese]

Reverted to older behavior for how modified input port fields are 
handled. The originally intended behavior is that a new field that 
intersected a previous field would completely wipe out the original 
field. Recently a change was made that changed the behavior to only 
remove a portion of the bits from the original field. This is actually 
problematic behavior, so the original behavior was restored.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed auto-center bug on analog joysticks. [Derrick Renaud]

Fixed UI when modifying the inc/dec/analog fields of an analog control
in sequence. [Derrick Renaud]

Corrected System 1 Z80 clocking: [Aaron Giles]
 * each opcode fetch is 2 cycles with /M1 low, so each byte of
    opcode fetching causes slightly longer delays than the previous
    tables
 * implemented approximate wait state timing for videoram access;
    further accuracy will rely on getting a dump of the PAL16R4
    that controls the horizontal video timing

Merged memory maps in taito_l.c, taito_x.c, taito_b.c, taito_f2.c,
taito_f3.c, surpratk.c, system16.c, system18.c. Also removed some word 
handlers in favor of using READ8/WRITE8 directly in address maps. 
Removed some additional unnecessary handlers in favor of using 
AM_READ_PORT. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the PPU2C0x implementation to be a device. [Nathan Woods]

Simplified the gun port handling in the Sammy Outdoor Shooting games.
[Derrick Renaud]

Small System 1 update: [Aaron Giles]
 * correct video timing
 * removed "small" video drivers for games that properly mask the
    scrolling areas

Correct sound ROM for T-Mek 4.4 [Lars Bull]

Partial fix to bug MT 3070 (harddriv & racedriv do not show anymore 
P2 inputs for analog controls). Still thinking about steeltal.
[Fabio Priuli]
