Source Changes
--------------
Fixed compilation errors if HAS_SAMPLES is 0. [Nathan Woods]

Stop crash/assert when trying to decrease the debugger memory window 
bytes per line to 0. [Phil Bennett]

Improved implementations for undocumented instructions 63, 67, 6f, 73, 
77, 7b, 7f, 9c, 9e, ab, e3, e7, ef, f3, f7, fb, and ff in the n2a3 
cpu core. [Wilbert Pol]

Force recalculation of screen parameters when only the MC6845 input 
clock changes. [Wilbert Pol]

Seibu CRTC part 1: [Angelo Salese]
 * Merged Sengoku Mahjong & Good e Jong video HWs
 * Added correct scrolling functions for Sengoku Mahjong
 * Removed some positioning kludges in both drivers

Fixed Sengoku Mahjong hopper error after first winning match. 
[Angelo Salese]

Removed deprecat dependancy from Good e Jong, one irq wasn't needed 
at all (points to a reti). [Angelo Salese]

Fixed cpu reset for upd78c06. [Wilbert Pol]

Added new #define ENDIANNESS_NATIVE, which maps to either 
ENDIANNESS_LITTLE or ENDIANNESS_BIG based on the LSB_FIRST definition. 
Unlink LSB_FIRST, ENDIANNESS_NATIVE always exists and can be used in 
expressions without invoking the preprocessor. [Aaron Giles]

Added macro ENDIAN_VALUE_LE_BE() which selects one of two values based
on the endianness passed in. Also added NATIVE_ENDIAN_VALUE_LE_BE()
which calls ENDIAN_VALUE_LE_BE with ENDIANNESS_NATIVE. [Aaron Giles]

Updated a number of drivers and call sites to use these macros in 
favor of #ifdef LSB_FIRST. [Aaron Giles]

Removed some stray ADDR2BYTE/BYTE2ADDR macros that have been replaced 
by inline functions. [Aaron Giles]

DRC frontends must now do their own opcode fetching unfortunately. 
Updated all DRC cores to do this. Also tweaked a few oddities in the 
SH2 DRC. [Aaron Giles]

drw80pkr changes: [Jim Stolis]
 - Added bankswitching to program memory
 - Partial graphics support
 - Partial sound support

Preliminary ADPCM hook-up to Jantotsu, it plays something but it's 
not yet right. [Angelo Salese]

Removed redundant config parameter from SND_START. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed gfx regression with 18 Holes Pro Golf and added proper memory 
map for the second cpu. [Angelo Salese]

Sound cores no longer allocate their own tokens. Instead they return 
a new integer value indicating the size of token they want, and the 
core allocates it for them. This mirrors the standard device behavior.
[Aaron Giles]

SRMP5 update [tsBTN0640]
 - sound pitch is low with current st0016 driver.

Fixed Perfect Soldiers input (added missing button3) [a3SEybxT0]

Added missing key for sfiiij and sfiii2j [swzp1Dp/0]

Tidied up the micro3d driver and fixed sound. [Phil Bennett]

Increased Cloak & Dagger interleave quantum to eliminate 'SLAVE COM 
BAD' startup message. [Phil Bennett]

Major cleanup to IGS poker games [Mirko Buffoni]
 - Renamed csk driver to igspoker.  This includes Champion Poker, 
    Champion Skill, New Champion Skill
 - Converted drivers to tilemap system and unified video section
 - Unified memory maps and checked all input ports
 - Removed obsolete palette handlers and made use of generic handlers
 - Added layout for lamps handling
 - Added hopper simulation
 - Added New Champion Skill (different set, maybe original 
    international release) and renamed current igs_ncs to igs_ncs2 
    (2000 version for italian market)
 - Promoted igs_ncs2 to working state, but set GAME_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS 
    (missing initial notice screen)
 - Moved Jackie to a separate driver (it's a slot machine game)
 - Made some progress on Jackie which now boots (toggle mode to play, 
    but work still needs to be done)

Virtual Combat and Shadow Fighters update. [Phil Bennett]
 * Fixed framebuffer handling & screen parameters.
 * Added sound.
 * Corrected RAM sizes to match what is present on the PCBs.
 * Hooked up NVRAM.

Fixed clamping to 12 bit range to Okim6376, and adjusted volume
attenuation accordingly. [Mirko Buffoni]

Fixed TMS5220 speech in Turbo Sub [Phil Bennett, Jay Gallagher]

adp improvements: [robiza]
 - implemented p1 inputs in skattv and fashiong (service mode is 
    working)

Defined ROM_LOAD64_WORD/ROM_LOAD64_WORD_SWAP in emu/romload.h.
[Phil Bennett]

cb2001: mapped two more opcodes. [robiza]

Fixed Soul Calibur (vs. Inferno) [4oj9/xJ+0]

Added custom 3-screen layout to Stepping Stage driver. [Naibo Zhang]

Changed yunsung8 oki xtal to 400khz, verified on pcb. Unfortunately 
I couldn't verify the main xtal which was missing on my pcb.
[Corrado Tomaselli]

Restored previous cycle eating behavior in gstream. [Mamesick]

Changed device start routines to no longer return a status. Instead,
if a device needs to delay its initialization pending the startup
of another device, it must call the new function device_delay_init().
[Olivier Galibert]
