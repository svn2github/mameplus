0.104u4
-------

IMPORTANT CHANGES FOR OSD DEVELOPERS: 

1. osd_pause is no longer called directly. Rather, your osd_init 
function should register the osd_pause callback (if necessary) using 
add_pause_callback.

2. osd_die and is now handled by the core; you should remove this
function from the OSD layer.

3. logerror is front-ended in the core; it calls to a new OSD
function osd_logerror which handles the OS-specific file and/or 
debugger logging.

Source Changes
--------------
Added comments support to the debugger. You can now dynamically add
comments that are visible next to the disassembly view. Comments are
saved to an XML-based .cmt file in a 'comments' directory by default
upon exiting. [Andrew Gardner]

Added "wb+" disposition to osd_tool_fopen. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed cheat timer to fire at the correct rate. Also fixed 
initialization order to work around dependency on the video/UI
system. [Ian Patterson]

Added save states to 3 more drivers: arkanoid.c, system1.c, and
taitosj.c, and to the SN76496 sound chip for system1. [Adam Bousley]

Fixed a couple of small memory leaks and a crash bug found by 
valgrind. [Lawrence Gold]

Added save state support to the tetrisp2 driver. [Nathan Woods]

Added save state support to Cloak and Dagger, Mario Bros, Crazy 
Baloon, and the SN76477 sound chip. [Adam Bousley]

Hooked up the R4650 properly in the MIPS recompiler. [R. Belmont]

More Namco System 23 progress: [R. Belmont]
 - Further hardware work
 - Hooked up H8/3002 MCU and sound system
 - Many notes added
 - Final Furlong 2 (World and Japan sets) added

Added sanity checking to the set_visible_area() call to ensure it is
not set larger than the screen bitmap. [Nathan Woods]

Added decryption of the BIOS for the Namco System 10 games using MEMN 
ROM boards. [smf]

Changed the ROM banking of the Bellfruit 'Adder' card to the new
standard, as well as tidying up the MPU4 emulation with some new 
information. [El Condor]

A bit more progress on Raiden 2 sprite decryption. [Olivier Galibert]

Added save states to Namco Classics Collection 1 & 2, Taito B System,
and fixed save states in Operation Wolf. [Adam Bousley]

Debugger changes/updates: [Aaron Giles]
 - added new streaming text buffer system
 - rewrote the console window to use the streaming text buffer
 - added new log window (Ctrl+L) which displays live error.log output
 - added disassembly view menu to control comments versus raw or
    encrypted opcodes
 - added disassembly menu to the main console window as well
 - now detect expressions with assignment or ++/-- operators as
    commands, do you can just say "pc=0" to modify registers instead
    of needing to type "do pc=0"
 - fixed bug that would sometimes lock the disassembly view to the
    top line

More global system cleanup: [Aaron Giles, Atari Ace]
 - remapped osd_die to fatalerror, which cleans up behind itself and
    returns to the osd code by returning from run_game
 - removed a number of unnecessary includes from driver.h
 - moved logerror into the core
 - moved 68000-specific build rules to cpu.mak
 - new function skip_this_frame, should be called by drivers instead
    of osd_skip_this_frame
 - removed includes of osdepend.h and osd_cpu.h from drivers; only the
    core should include these

More initialization/reset/pause cleanup: [Aaron Giles]
 - new function add_pause_callback can be called by other modules to
    register a callback for whenever MAME is paused/resumed
 - converted all existing pause hooks to use the new system
 - new function add_reset_callback can be called by other modules to
    register a callback for whenever MAME is reset
 - converted all existing reset hooks to use the new system
 - removed machine_reset; replaced with mame_schedule_soft_reset
 - new function mame_schedule_exit to force an exit cleanly from
    external events
 - removed all the "trying_to_quit" crap from the Windows code
 - moved save/restore system out of cpuexec.c into mame.c
 - moved core game loop out of cpuexec.c into mame.c
 - added hard reset support (complete tear down and re-init)

More core file shuffling: [Aaron Giles]
 - split sndintrf.c into sound.c, sndintrf.c, and sndhrdw/generic.c
 - added #include vidhrdw/generic.h to mamecore.h, and removed all 
    explicit includes elsewhere

Added save state support to the BSMT2000 sound emulator and the
dcheese driver. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed missing save state data in the dkong driver. [Aaron Giles]

Updated the 68000 disassembler to use the new interfaces.
