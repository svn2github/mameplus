Fixed bug in overflow handling and SUBC emulation in the TMS32010
core. [Rainer Keuchel]

Reverted Mario Bros. graphics offset since it caused issues 
elsewhere. [Derrick Renaud]

Enhanced chd.c to support hunk sizes up to 16MB, versus the previous
64k limit. [Aaron Giles]

Added hooks to chd.c to specify codec-specific configuration info.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed obsolete timing parameter from stream_update(). [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up cdrom.c. Removed audio implementation and relocated code
into sound/cdda.c. Changed metadata format to be textual instead of
binary (old metadata format is still supported). Removed external
access to CHD positions; all accesses are now done at the physical
LBA level and converted internally. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for split CHD files. CHD files can be transparently
split into multiple pieces and left that way during read access.
Modifications to split files are always written to the last file.
A new command chdman -split is now available to split an existing
CHD file. [Aaron Giles]

Added new option -fontpath to control where the font files are loaded
from. [Aaron Giles]

Added ability for options_add_entries() to override defaults 
specified in the core. To do this, simply include an option in the
list with the same name as the core option and provide a new default.
This default will override the one specified in the core.
