Source Changes
--------------
Fixed subtle bug in the UI menu handler that only manifested on
mingw-based compiles. [Nicola Salmoria]

Updated CHD locating behavior to accept CHDs referenced by the 
parent of a clone if the hash matches, even if it has a different
name. [smf]

Improved flash emulation and added support for Fujitsu flash chips.
Switches Konami games over to new flash chips. [smf]

Improved behavior of SCSI CD implementation for audio playback and
TOC reading commands. [R. Belmont]

Fixed priorities and the offset of layer 3 in fcrash. [robiza]

Added save state support to the COP4xx core. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the new disassembler and override callback prototypes to
take const parameters and to remove the generally unused 'bytes'
parameter. The disassemblers can now assume that the buffers contain
enough bytes to hold the maximum instruction length as returned by
the CPU core get_info callback. [Aaron Giles]

Converted the following disassemblers to the new format, and added
step in/out support where it was obvious: adsp21xx, alph8201, 
arm, arm7, asap, ccpu, cdp1802, cop4x0, dsp32c, e132xs, g65816, 
h6280, h83002, i8x41, i960, i8051, i8085, jaguar, m680x, m6805, 
m37710, mc68hc11, pic16c5x, rsp, s2650, se3208, sh2, sharc, t11,
tms32010, tms32025, tms32031, tms34010, upd7810, v60, v810, z180,
and z8000. [Aaron Giles]

Deprecated the old disassembler interfaces in favor of the new ones.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed subtle bug in subtable allocation in the memory system that
caused the Eolith games to assert with the debugger. [Aaron Giles]

Tweaked the disassembly view to detect if the disassembly for the
current instruction has changed, and if so, recompute the entire 
view. This provides more dynamic updating when system states change
under certain CPUs. [Aaron Giles]

Added new symbol 'curpc' for all CPUs which represents the value of
the current instruction pointer, to avoid naming conflicts with the
'pc' register in other contexts. Changed this to be the default
value for the disassembly window in the Windows version of the
debugger (OSD ports will need to do likewise). [Aaron Giles]



New clones added

Trivia (Version 1.01C) [Brian Troha]
Space Battle (bootleg set 2) [Brian Troha]
