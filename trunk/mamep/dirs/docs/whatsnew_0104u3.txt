IMPORTANT CHANGE FOR OSD DEVELOPERS: osd_exit is no longer called
directly. Rather, your osd_init function should register the osd_exit 
callback (if necessary) using add_exit_callback. Also, several global
variables have been moved into the Machine structure:

   mame_debug -> Machine->debug_mode
   playback   -> Machine->playback_file
   record     -> Machine->record_file

Source Changes
--------------
Cleanups to the taito_x driver: [Alex Jackson]
 - Converted input ports to an INCLUDE/MODIFY tree.
 - Fixed Lives DSW in twinhawk and twinhwku
 - Removed Cabinet DSW from twinhawk and twinhwku; they are 2psim 
    and do not support cocktail cabinets (the DSW does nothing).
 - Fixed Coinage DSW in suprmanj
 - removed MDRV_MACHINE_INIT(cchip1) from games that don't have a 
    c-chip (all of them except superman)

Fixed chdman to write the correct number of logical bytes when
extracting something that is not an even number of hunks large.
[Chris Hardy]

Some Raiden 2 documentation and input port updates (still not 
playable). [Olivier Galibert]

Created new osd_tool file which is used by utility tools to do
file access in an OS independent manner. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed typo in Hyperstone core that led to false positive warning
popups. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added support for IDT-specific MIPS MUL instruction in the MIPS3
core, recompiler, and disassembler. [R. Belmont, Aaron Giles]

Replaced -high_priority with -priority, you can now specify from 
-15 to 1. The default is -15 as this makes Dell laptop keyboards 
work. It still won't raise the priority if running with the debugger,
but it will lower it. Fixed a subtle bug at the same time as 
-high_priority was only working when you used rdtsc. [smf]

Added an optional xml_parse_options parameter to xml_file_read() 
and xml_string_read(), to provide options for preserving whitespace,
error reporting, and parser setup. [Nathan Woods]

Added save states to 2 simple drivers - bombjack.c and blktiger.c. 
[Adam Bousley]

Improved graphics ROM loading order in fredmem. [Luigi30]

New option -mngwrite, which records an MNG movie of the game from
the get-go and allows you to specify a target filename. [Buddabing]

Refactored/renamed/removed/added several core files: [Aaron Giles]
 - renamed driver.c to mamedriv.c
 - created a new driver.c containing functions defined in driver.h
 - split common.c into video.c and machine/generic.c
 - moved a number of mame.c functions to video.c

New file debugger.h contains abstracted debugging interfaces for
both debuggers. Added new call mame_debug_break() and a new macro
DEBUGGER_BREAK to make it easier to hard-code breakpoints into code.
Removed all old code that directly whacked debug_key_pressed or
called debug_halt_on_next_instruction and replaced them with calls
to DEBUGGER_BREAK. [Aaron Giles]

Added #include "state.h" to driver.h. This means most driver files
no longer need to explicitly include it. Went through and removed it
from most drivers. [Aaron Giles]

Reorganized the core initialization/exit sequencing to be "flatter"
and more straightforward to understand. System cleanup is now no
longer explicitly called by the code in mame.c. Rather, each init
function is free to register an exit handler, which will be called
in reverse order of registration upon a system exit. [Aaron Giles]

Removed default registrations from config_init() into the init
functions of the associated modules. Now each system that has config
data can register its own callbacks to process it. [Aaron Giles]

Renamed MACHINE_INIT to MACHINE_RESET to normalize the naming of the
callbacks defined in the MACHINE_DRIVER structure. Added several new
callbacks. The complete list is now:

   DRIVER_INIT -- per-game init called once at startup
   MACHINE_START/SOUND_START/VIDEO_START -- called once at startup
   MACHINE_RESET/SOUND_RESET/VIDEO_RESET -- called each reset

Save state registrations should be performed in DRIVER_INIT or 
(preferably) in the _START callbacks; they should be avoided in the 
_RESET callbacks if possible. [Aaron Giles]

Removed VIDEO_DUAL_MONITOR flag. [Aaron Giles]

Added a number of new properties to the debug views to allow for more
flexibility in the way the views are displayed. Also added an option
to the disassembly window to display encrypted opcode data on the
right. [Aaron Giles]

Save state changes: [Aaron Giles]
 - Audited the use of save state registrations throughout the code,
    switching most cases over to using the state_save_register_global
    or state_save_register_item macros to simplify the code.
 - Deprecated the save_state_register_<type> calls since nearly all 
    cases can be automatically handled by the macros. For odd cases, 
    there is now a save_state_register_memory call which is generic.
 - Simplified the save state logic, allowing for unlimited instances
    and reducing the complexity of the code. This breaks existing save
    states. Sorry, I'll try not to do it again.

Fixed save state support in Missile Command. [Aaron Giles]

Added oversampling support to the CEM3394 emulator. [Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the CEM3394 and NES APU sound chips.
[Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to the jedi, balsente and dkong drivers. 
[Aaron Giles]
