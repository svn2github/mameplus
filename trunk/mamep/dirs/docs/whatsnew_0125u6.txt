MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
- 00181: [Sound] ddragon3: OKI volume is too low in MAME. (sonikos)
- 00417: [Sound] ddragon3: the title voice should start when the 
         background tune hits its highest note. (sonikos)
- 01441: [Sound] ctribe, ddragon3: The OKI6295 playback frequency is 
         too high. (sonikos)
- 01888: [DIP/Input] raidena, raidenk, raident: Flip screen DIP switch 
         doesn't work. (couriersud)



Source Changes
--------------
MIPS3 recompiler: [Aaron Giles]
 * added UML comments for common state variables
 * removed some unused fields
 * implemented LL/LLD/SC/SCD (only works single-processor for now)

Added sound emulation to Wily Tower, Atomic Boy and Fighting 
Basketball. [Tomasz Slanina]

Improvements to squahitsa. [David Haywood]

Progress on protection simulation for 2 Crystal System titles. Still 
not working. [ElSemi]

Some progress on tankfrc4 inputs. [David Haywood]

Created common virtual TLB managment module. Updated MIPS and PowerPC 
code to make use of it. [Aaron Giles]

Added a validity check against reading input ports at init time.
[Curt Coder]

Cleaned up software bilinear filtering code. Added bounds checking.
Enabled by default for snapshots and movie rendering. [Aaron Giles]

Added new option: -snapsize, which lets you specify the target
resolution for snapshots and movies. The existing behavior is still
the default: create snapshots and movies at native pixel 
resolutions. [Aaron Giles]

Added new option: -snapview, which lets you specify a particular
view to use for rendering snapshots and movies. The existing 
behavior is still the default: use a special internal view and 
render each screen to its own snapshot in its own file. When using 
this option to specify a view other than 'internal', only a single 
snapshot file will be produced regardless of how many screens the 
game has. [Aaron Giles]

Improved AVI and MNG recording to properly duplicate/skip frames
as appropriate to keep the correct framerate. [Aaron Giles]

Added new function video_get_view_for_target() which selects a view 
based on a command-line parameter and the configuration. Changed 
Windows OSD code to use this instead of its own logic. Changed 
-snapview to share the logic as well, enabling 'auto' as a -snapview 
option. [Aaron Giles]

Renamed "Nintendo z80gb" cpu core to "Sharp LR35902". [Wilbert Pol]

UML: [Aaron Giles]
 - reactivated back-end validation mechanism
 - added back-end validation for ADD/SUB/MUL/DIV/CMP forms
 - fixed several errors in dealing with more obscure flag combinations

konamigx frequency tweaks: [Yasuhiro Ogawa]
 - set screen refresh rate to 58Hz (parameters from  developer manual 
    are not 100% correct)
 - removed sound CPU clock hack

Set tecmosys screen refresh rate to measured 57.4458Hz. [Guru]

Added missing machine parameters and removed deprecat.h usage in a
number of drivers/ and machine/ files. [Oliver Stoenberg]

Changed all games after Street Fighter 2 CE to have a 12mhz clock. 
Verified on Megaman and Quiz and dragons (original kits with plastic
case). I am resonably sure all the other games after ST2CE have the 
DASH cps1 board with 12mhz clock. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Converted many drivers in the d-j alphabetical range to use
input_port_read() instead of input_port_read_indexed(). [Fabio Puiuli]

ddragon3 driver cleanups/fixes: [sonikos]
 - Fixed the mess dips location in ctribe
 - Added dips location in all sets of ddragon3
 - Added the missing dips (now are 8x2) on ctribe,ctribe1,ctribeb,
    ctribb2 and ddrago3b
 - Fixed the "Stage Clear Energy" dips in ctribe
 - Adjusted the frame rate from 60hz to around 57 as reported on 
    mametester ID 00417
 - Adjusted OKI frequency to 1.000mhz (according to recording on 
    mametester ID 00181)
 - Adjusted the ddragon3 & ctribe volume (according to recording on 
    mametester ID 00181 and 01441)

Some protection improvements for vgoalsoc / tecmo world cup 98.
