have different encryption. [robiza]

Added a stop4 input to slot default and remapped slot default keys to 
better suit Amcoe games. [Fabio Priuli]

Updated sfbonus.c to use the new gambling inputs. Fixed many years

Hanafuda games to use them. Like for Mahjong games, keys A->H are used.
"Yes" is mapped to M, "No" is mapped to N. [Fabio Priuli]

Add correct color PROM for panther. [Mr. Do, Angelo Salese]

nmk16.c driver documentation update / clean up: [Briah Troha]

NVRAM not to save correctly. [Tafoid]

Aristocrat MK-4 HW: Hooked up mc6845, fixed a rom crc in goldenc and 
implemented flip y. [Angelo Salese]

DIP switch cleanups in gberet, mainevt, ninjakd2, and taito_z. 
[kanikani]

Added GAME_IMPERFECT_SOUND flag to all sets that use external samples 
which were not already flagged for sound. Flagged Speed Freak 
(speedfrk) as GAME_SUPPORTED_SAVE to match the rest of the driver.
[Tafoid]

SNES video updates: [Fabio Priuli]
 * re-enabled video debug functionalities in debug build (to toggle 
    background layers)
 * added proper priority tables for various bg/obj layers
 * largely simplified tile and line drawing routines, and fixed small 
    bits here and there
 * further simplification of tile drawing routines
 * added palette index to 8bpp tiles (correct color_shift still unsure, 
    though)
 * reworked video drawing routine to simplify the various graphic 
    mode drawing and to allow proper implementation of priority orders 
    (especially bg3 priority bit and mode 7 priority order)
 * improved mode 7 extbg (still missing mosaic)
 * added some more debugging options
 * improved Mode 7 math precision (but still some issues remain) and 
    added a few elements to PPU struct
 * implemented Mosaic in Mode 7
 * merged OAM functions
 * added a few elements to PPU struct (this might be handy if we ever 
    come to convert SNES PPU to a device)
 * fixed Mode 7 shared scrolling/matrix registers
 * slightly optimized Mode 7 math (by using Anomie's recursive 
    formula)
 * moved some more register contents to PPU struct
 * added PPU1/PPU2 Open Bus support, STAT77/STAT78 registers should be
    more accurate (even if still not perfect)
 * simplified window masking code and moved some more regs to PPU 
    struct

More NES work: [Robert Bohms]
 * Fixed bug in nes_apu that caused errors reading $4015
 * Added length counter status bits to $4015
 * Fixed 4-screen mirroring (PPU regression)
 * Fixed cham24
 * Improved Sprite Overflow emulation of NES PPU (this fixes the first 
    of blargg's Sprite Overflow tests)

Added remaining PCB "U" locations to roms that didn't have for 
G-Stream G2020. [Brian Troha]

Atomiswave updates: [R. Belmont, Cah4e3]
 - Hooked up flash ROM at 0
 - Use proper AW memory map
 - Emulate AW ROM board (different from Naomi)

Fixed buggy breakpoints in the g65816 cpu core. [Angelo Salese]

Fixed Atomiswave COIN ERROR. [Wind]

n8080 update [Team Japump!!!]
 - corrected ROM names for Space Fever and SF High Splitter
 - renamed spacefeva to spacefevo2
 - added spacefevo
 - added highspltb

Updated Sega Hikaru readme [Guru]

Discrete sound update: [couriersud]
 - Added "abs" function to DISCRETE_TRANSFORM
 - Fixed a bug in DISCRETE_RCDISC5

Added 1 missing sample to safarir.c [Team Japump!!!]

Created discrete sound emulation for galaxian [couriersud]
 - Changed all audio related AM_WRITE to AM_DEV_WRITE
 - Moved discrete sound related pieces such as initialization into 
    audio/galaxian.h
 - Split some memory maps into sound related and not sound related 
    parts.
 - Added possibility in discrete.h to select hardware (galaxian/moon 
    cresta) at compile time. This leads to slightly different volume 
    levels. Hit sound (explosion) has been hacked to increase volume. 
    Currently, we can not accurately model the switch/opamp filter 
    circuit.
 - Rewrote timer code so that the pitch timer is only used when it 
    produces audible results.

Cojag/jaguar video updates (primarily for MESS) [Robbbert]
 * Added variable pixel width.
 * Fixed display of screens wider than 360 pixels.
 * Enabled use of RGB16.

looping: modified the cop420 rom region, fixed mcu rom region in clone 
set, added mcu support. [robiza]

Redumped bingor2 program roms [Klaus Sommers]

Corrected Kamakazi III's dipswitch setting (the same as superg) and 
relabeled it a superg hack. Also the dipswitch setting for the Taito 
license was the same as superg so I eliminated one. [Brian Troha]

Improved speaker-toggle emulation with alias filter. 
[Anders Hallstrom]

NES: Fixed bank switching in multigm3 (broken due to a mistake of 
mine when including original Rob Bohms' code). The game still refuses 
to work, unfortunately. [Fabio Priuli]

vsnes update [Team Japump!!!]
 - fixed ROM names
 - added vssoccerj

ROM name fixes for sicv, sisv, and sisv2 [Team Japump!!!]

Corrected TNZS vsync to 59.15 as verified on pcb. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Fixed bootleg description inconsistency in goldnpkr.c. [hap]

Fixed sprite wrapping in sonson. [hap]

Added Intel 4004 CPU core. [Miodrag Milanovic]

Converted the tilemap lists to be private information held by the
running_machine instead of global variables. Added new APIs to the
tilemap code to handle the "ALL_TILEMAPS" cases, and removed the
old ALL_TILEMAPS definition. [Atari Ace]

Added redumped gfx rom on Shogun Warrior [Guru]

Updated romload.c and validity.c to not rely on global variables.
[Atari Ace]

Corrected resistor values in Cliff Hanger discrete sound based on 
actual PCB values. [Ruben Panossian]

Removed DAA tables from the 8085 and Z180 implementations in favor of
just computing the values. Also fixed code in 8085 to prevent
accidental multiple reads due to macro overuse. [hap]

Added game time and coinage DIP switches to Space Walk, along with
service mode and test. Also added support for the 2nd controller and
coin counter. Removed GAME_NOT_WORKING as it is working fine. Added
color overlay based on photo. [hap]

Added a simple color overlay for Depthcharge based on flyers. [hap]

    severe priority problems in devilw, but reintroduces bugs on 
    gradius2 level 7 and ending
