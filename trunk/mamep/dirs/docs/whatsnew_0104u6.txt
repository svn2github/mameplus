Source Changes
--------------
Fixed various problems introduced in the last set of changes.
[Aaron Giles, Nathan Woods, Ville Linde]

Fixed dip-switches in Action Fighter. [Chaneman]

Improved samples support for Congo Bongo. [Chris Law]

Some improvements imported from MAME Plus!
 * added save state support to pd4990a device for neogeo
 * fixed crash in nitrobal/gunball (stage 4, right route) [xvi]

Got Polygonet Warriors back to the POST screen. [Andrew Gardner]

Reduced global namespace pollution by marking many global functions
explicitly static, especially in the CPU cores.
[Atari Ace, Aaron Giles]

Some improvements to Magical Error. Title and attract works. No 
sound. Hangs in game. Problems with shared mem and main-sub cpu 
communciation. [Tomasz Slanina]

Added validity checks to ensure CPU core completeness. [Nathan Woods]

Added DIP switches for Agress. [Roberto Fresca]

Added the missing commands and proper maker/device ids to the flash
memory handlers for Fujitsu MBM29F016A, used by Konami FireBeat.
[Ville Linde]

Added preliminary support for the Jaleco color blending hardware 
found in Psychic 5, Argus, and Valtric. (Some functionality is still 
unknown). [Andrew Gardner]

Major update to the Aleck64 driver. Still not fully working yet.
[Ville Linde]

Fixed comment display for processors which use an ADDRBUS_SHIFT.
[Andrew Gardner]

[Nathan Woods]

Added movie recording time to the internal profiler. [Nathan Woods]

Added oversampling support to the Exidy custom sound and to the DAC
sound system. [Aaron Giles]

Sega vector game updates: [Aaron Giles]
 - Rewrote vector generator from schematics. Yes, it is supposed to
    be that jumpy on zooms!
 - Corrected CPU speeds and cleaned up memory maps.
 - Connected AY-8912 to Zektor for missing sound effects.
 - Added emulation of the Universal Sound Board -- not yet perfected,
    but gets rid of the need for samples in Star Trek and Tac/Scan.
    Tac/Scan sounds pretty wretched now, but Star Trek is close.
 - Fixed CPU clock speed on the speech board, but it appears to be a
    bit too slow now.
 - This is still work-in-progress. Don't report bugs yet.
