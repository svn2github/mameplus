Source Changes
--------------
Improvements to the Sang Ho driver, making them somewhat playable.
[David Haywood, Tomasz Slanina]

Fixed off-by-one drawing error in the Pasha Pasha 2 driver.
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed some instruction forms in the 6309 diassembler to consume
the correct number of bytes. [Nicola Salmoria]

Added back support for DirectDraw. Unlike the old support, this 
requires DirectX 7 or later. There is now a new option to control
what video system is being used for rendering. Use -video d3d to use
Direct3D. Use -video ddraw to use DirectDraw. And use -video gdi to
force the use of GDI for rendering. Also added back the -hwstretch
option to control whether or not DirectDraw does stretching. Added
support for the -prescale option when using DirectDraw as well. It
should also work ok with multiple screens. [Aaron Giles]

Added a compile-time option to rendersw.c to prevent reads from the
destination. This removes the ability to do a number of blends and
effects, but allows you to point the software renderer at a video
memory target and not kill performance. It also improves performance
of software rendering in general by avoiding expensive alpha blending
operations. [Aaron Giles]

Improved font logic so that small fonts are scaled more appropriately
at low resolutions. It's not perfect, but works well for most games
when running with the new DirectDraw option, which always renders
games at minimum resolution. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug that messed up partial updating. Hopefully it all should be
back to normal again. [Aaron Giles]
