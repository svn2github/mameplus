Source Changes
--------------
Fixes clocks for Orbs. [David Haywood, Tomasz Slanina]

Fixed various 64-bit GCC warnings. [R. Belmont]

Improves accuracy and documentation of NSS/SNES DSP-1.
[Andreas Naive, R. Belmont]

Added new file xtal.h, documenting all known arcade PCB clock cystals.
Drivers should be updated to use these as a basis for their clocks,
and the list should be augmented as additional crystals are found.
[Guru, Aaron Giles]

suprloco improvements: [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
 * Fixed IC.34 memory test 
 * Fixed 2nd player cocktail mode
 * Changed coin3 to service1
 
Cleaned up inputs/DIP switches in cninja driver. [Brian Troha]

Rewrote mario.c: [couriersud]
 - rewrote driver, separate MACHINE_DRIVER(mario_audio)
 - palette from schematics
 - video timing from schematics
 - driver configuration switch Nintendo/Std Monitor
 - got rid of COLORTABLE

Fixed typo for IO1 irq callback in hyperstone core. 
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added memory_get_bank() function. Fixed logging in memory.c to to use 
%p for pointer values. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed save states in i8051 cpu core [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Implemented a few SysCtrl, Maple, and PVR/HOLLY bits for Naomi. The 
BIOS gets slightly further but is nowhere near starting up. 
[R. Belmont]

Zeus updates: [Aaron Giles]
 * Better documented various bit latches.
 * Hooked up crusnexo lamp board (added layout).
 * Fixed year in MK4 startup test.

Fixed TMS5110 tables. [couriersud, Lord Nightmare]

Removed ui_popup(). Drivers should always be using popmessage() 
instead (has been this way for a while). Augmented popmessage() so 
that you can pass NULL to immediately dismiss any messages.
[Aaron Giles, thanks to Oliver Stoneberg's suggestion]

Added ATTR_PRINTF to a number of functions that have printf semantics.
[Oliver Stoneberg]

Rewrote sbrkout driver based on schematics: [Aaron Giles]
 * XTAL-based timing
 * Correct video timing
 * Full memory map
 * Correct memory usage ("zero page" RAM is shared with videoram)
 * Removed all input hacks
 * Fixed interrupt generation
 * Connected coin counters
 * Added save state support

Fixed several UNICODE=1 issues in the debugger. Changed the Windows
build process to always enable UNICODE=1 for 64-bit builds.
[Oliver Stoneberg, Aaron Giles]

Added save state support to btoads. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed onna34ro mcu simulation properly. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
