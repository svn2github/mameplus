Source Changes
--------------
Added new function mame_debug_is_active() which can be used by
core code to identify when we are paused in the debugger.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed crash when passing an invalid driver name on the command line.
Centralized the approximate matching logic into driver.c so other
ports can use it as well. [Aaron Giles]

Now properly extracting path from driver name and adding it to the
rompath so that drag & drop of ZIP files works once again.

More renderer updates: [Aaron Giles]
 - Fixed feature detection bug that led to false-positive warnings
    when starting up
 - Removed extra vertex padding since some graphics cards could not
    cope with it
 - Added shims to support both Direct3D 9 and Direct3D 8; D3D9 is
    the default, with an automatic fallback to d3d8 if not available
 - New option -d3dversion can be used to specify preferred version
    for testing
 - Added 1 pixel black border around all textures to ensure filtering
    on some cards doesn't result in garbage at the edge of the screen
 - Enabled "do not wait" feature when unthrottled and using D3D9; this
    greatly speeds up unthrottled games, but seems to only work in 
    full screen mode
 - Switched from triangle fans to triangle strips
 - Ensured that render states are only being set minimally
 - Added code to reset the device if lost, allowing application 
    switching out of full screen mode and fixing multi-monitor mode
    with resolution switching

Added new function verbose_printf() which is used instead of checking
the verbose global to print information to the screen. Changed all
locations that were checking the global to use this new function.
