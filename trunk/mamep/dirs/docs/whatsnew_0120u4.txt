Source Changes
--------------
Made some minor changes in the inline code. The result of 
atomic_add32 isn't used a lot of the time, so the final addition was
brought out to allow it to be optimized away. Removed the unnecessary 
delta argument from atomic_increment32 and atomic_decrement32 in 
eminline.h, and added implementations.  Changed the condition for 
using rgbsse.h to include 32-bit platforms with SSE enabled.
[Vas Crabb]

Did a major clean-up of the input ports in ssv.c. Brought out the 
common joystick, mahjong and quiz input setups, and then used  
PORT_INCLUDE to pull them in when needed. Also brought out the  
common coinage settings, to avoid needless repetition. [Vas Crabb]

Analyzed all driver interfaces (DRIVER_INIT, READ8_HANDLER, etc.) to
determine which ones should be made static and properly tagged them
all to reduce global namespace pollution. Some cases turned out to be
dead code, which was also properly tagged. [Atari Ace]

Updated the Tube Panic driver, fixing the background scroll-in (it's 
smooth again now). The problem was caused by wrong synchronization 
between main and slave CPUs. Also modified the video driver to be 
scanline accurate and implemented more accurate interrupt handling.
[Jarek Burczynski]

Altered TTL low high levels in res_net.c. This will broaden the color 
range a bit. Since the results are normalized, there is only a limited 
effect visible. [couriersud]

Cleaned up inputs and added dip locations in ms32.c. Also fixed dips 
in "47pie2" and "akiss". [Sonikos]

Fixed bug that caused incorrect input to be read if multiple inputs
were mapped to the same mouse input under Windows. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed a bug in the i8051 core that improperly fired the Timer2 
interrupt when it wasn't enabled. [Jim Stolis]

Updates to the peplus driver: [Jim Stolis]
 * Added lightpen support
 * Added PE+ Superboard support
 * Added ABC coin optics support
 * Added full I2C eeprom support
 * Added NVRAM support
 * Corrected door closure issues
 * Removed most memory hacks
 * Consolidated machines and inputs
 * New layout for pepp0158

Split up the MPU4 driver into a core and driver set up a la NeoGeo.
Also made some timer fixes, and added some new ROMs added.
[James Wallace]

Fixed problems introduced when the junofrst blitter code was
simplified. [Chris Hardy]

American Poker II major rewrite: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Properly dervied clocks from crystals
 - Reworked TILE_GET_INFO to handle the proper tiles/color codes.
 - Fixed interrupts (NMI).
 - Corrected AY8910 frequency to 1.5 MHz to match the real thing.
 - Arranged the AY8910 volume in all games avoiding clips.
 - Corrected the screen visible area.
 - Added NVRAM support.
 - Reworked the memory map, mapping all the hardware I/O ports.
 - Reworked the Inputs for all sets.
 - Added implementation of Operator and Supervisor Keys.
 - Fixed some timing troubles.
 - Added partial DIP switch support with diplocations to all sets.
 - Removed the hack in DRIVER_INIT.
 - Hooked write handlers for output ports.
 - Added watchdog routines.
 - Dumped, hooked, wired and decoded the color PROM in all sets.
 - Modified the refresh rate according to hardware measurements.
 - Wired the lamps for all sets. Created their respective layouts.
 - Splitted the driver to driver/video.
 - Other minor fixes.

SCSP fixes: [kingshriek]
 * Fixed DECAY1 envelope state to not exit immediately
 * Improved support for LPSLNK and SBCTL
 * Fixed panning calculation bug
 * Fixed case where key-rate scaling is off

Added support for indicating that DIP switches are reversed in the
DIP locations view. [Vas Crabb]

Added DIP locations for Midway Tron and the Nintendo Donkey Kong 
series (dkong.c). [Vas Crabb]

Added an Altivec/VMX implementation of the RGB utilities for our 
friends with G4, G5 and POWER5 CPUs (rgbvmx.h) and added
rgbint_bilinear_filter and rgbaint_bilinear_filter to rgbsse.h (based  
on rgb_bilinear_filter/rgba_bilinear_filter) for completeness, as  
these functions exist in rgbgen.h. [Vas Crabb]

Updated model2.c, taitojc.c, and gticlub.c to use the new polygon 
routines. Deprecated the old poly.c and renamed polynew.* to poly.*.
[Aaron Giles]

Unified poly.c callbacks so that tri and quad callbacks work the
same way. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed display of floating point TMS32031 registers in the debugger.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed TMS32031 ABSF opcode to work as documented and not produce a
proper negative. [Aaron Giles]
