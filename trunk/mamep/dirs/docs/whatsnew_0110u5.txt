Source Changes
--------------
Improvements to the Polygonet Commanders driver: [Andrew Gardner]
 * Implemented various dsp56k opcodes
 * Polygonet Commanders now gets past the memory tests

Fixed the background color in perfrman. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Merged in some MESS-specific PC support code. [Nathan Woods]

Added mosaic effect to valtric. Yes, it looks as bad on real hardware
as in MAME :) [Tomasz Slanina]

Fixed colors in Honey Dolls. [David Haywood]

Added the final filtering stages to the sound, proper watchdog and 
memory mirroring to the circusc driver. Also added PORT_DIPLOCATION 
info and save state support. [Derrick Renaud]

Updated vconv.c to support preprocessor and assembly file output in
MSVC builds. [Nathan Woods]

Improved DIP switches for Honey Dolls and Twin Adventure. 
[Brian Troha]

Removed the "Autocenter Speed" menu entry for Analog Controls that do 
not use it. [Derrick Renaud]

Added a "Digital Speed" of 0 in the "Analog Controls" menu. This will 
cause the control to only inc/decrement once per button press no 
matter how long the button is pressed. Remember this is still scaled 
by the "Sensitivity" setting. [Derrick Renaud]

Scaled Windows mouse Z axis by 30 to make it usable. Most mice 
inc/decrement by 120 for each wheel click. Some rare ones are 30. So 
this means for most mice, using a Sensitivity setting of 25%, you 
will get 1 inc/decrement for each wheel click. [Derrick Renaud]

Cleaned up the cclimber driver, replacing hacks for cannonb with a
separate video update callback. [Mamesick]

Moved the ST-V protection related code into stvprot.c and added some 
notes about the decathlete protection and renamed stvhacks to 
stvinit, because it contains most of the inits as well as the 
speedhacks. [David Haywood]

Major funworld driver rewrite: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Merged/splitted some machine drivers, memory maps and inputs.
 - Unified get_bg_tile_info for all games.
 - Mapped the input buttons in a better format (all games).
 - Added proper color PROM decode routines.
 - Splitted the driver to driver/vidhrdw.
 - Corrected the screen size and visible area to magiccrd.
 - Added the remaining 2 GFX planes to magiccrd; GFX are imperfect.
 - Royalcrd: Added all inputs and DIP switches.
 - Fixed jolycdcr gfx to 4bpp.
 - Other fixes to get jolycdcr running.
 - Managed royalcdb to work, using the 2nd half of program ROM.
 - Managed jolycdit to work, but with imperfect graphics.
 - Fixed CPU clock to 2MHz. in all remaining games.
 - Fixed ay8910 frequency based on elephfam audio.
 - Fixed ay8910 volume in all games to avoid clipping.
 - Reworked jolycdcr, jolycdit inputs.
 - Set jolycdat as bigdeal clone. 
 - Added the bipolar PROM and GAL to jolycdit. 
 - Added color PROMs to cuoreuno and elephfam sets. 
 - Corrected jollycrd screen size and visible area.
 - Hooked, wired and decoded the color prom in jollycrd sets.
 - Wired and decoded the color prom in cuoreuno and elephfam sets.
 - Wired and decoded the color prom in royalcrd.
 - Hooked, wired and decoded the color prom in bigdeal sets.
 - Decrypted jolycdit gfx roms.
 - Decrypted jolycdae and managed the planes to show correct colors.

Minor Unicode changes for the Windows code. [Nathan Woods]

Added serial in/out support to the Amiga hardware. Added hooks for
output pins and light pen positioning. Also fixed the horrible static 
at startup in the debug build. [Aaron Giles]

Reorganized the laserdisc support a bit to accommodate new players.
Added Sony LDP-1450 support. [Aaron Giles]

Added new render texture format TEXFORMAT_YUY16, which is used to
hold 4:2:2 Y/Cb/Cr format pixels. Updated the Windows Direct3D code
and the software renderers to use this format directly. [Aaron Giles]

Added new render texture fromat TEXFORMAT_PALETTEA16, which is the
same as TEXFORMAT_PALETTE16 but respects the alpha component of the
palette entry. Updated the Windows Direct3D code and the software
renderers to use this format. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the render system to respect blendmodes for screen elements
rather than hard-coding them. This allows individual VIDEO_UPDATE
routines to do their own compositing. [Aaron Giles]

Removed the illusion from the rendering system that you could pass in
arbitrary palettes. The system palette is all that is supported.
