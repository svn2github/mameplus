Source Changes
--------------
MC6845 changes: [Curt Coder]

 - added preliminary support for SY6545-1's transparent addressing mode
 - Hsync should be pulsed even when vsync is active.

Removed per-game hacks from CPS3 (moved to DMA callback in SH2 core).
Removed Speedups from CPS3 / PsikyoSH, while they do still give a 
decent speed boost they're not really needed with the DRC and just 
clutter the code. [David Haywood]

Minor NeoGeo cleanups [JohnBoy]

Rewrite of the Motorola DSP56k CPU core. [Andrew Gardner]
 * Complete rewrite focusing on legibility and extensibility.
 * 27/121 opcodes (mostly) implemented.
 * Bugfix for reset status of interrupt priority bits.
 * Bugfix for disassembly of register-to-register parallel data move.
 * Added additional branch, move and bitfield ops.
 * Plygonet now passes its memory test and uploads a new program.
 * Implemented tst, or, jsr, rti, tst2, and 2 new movec ops.
 * Added opbase handler to plygonet.c

Increase cubeqst interleave factor to eliminate LDP timeout countdown 
flicker. [Philip Bennett]

Added redumped B-Rap Boys sample ROMs. [Guru]

Cleaned up STV rom loading a bit. [David Haywood]

NamcoNBx: fixed C75 BIOS loading for big-endian targets. [R. Belmont]

Updated tnzs.c driver: [stephh]
  - renamed sets :
      * 'tnzsjn'   -> 'tnzsj'
      * 'tnzsj'    -> 'tnzsjo'
      * 'kagekia'  -> 'kagekih'
  - fixed Dip Switches for all games (2 remaining unknown Dips in 
    'plumppop' and 'jpopnics' though)
  - added many notes

not working. [Angelo Salese]

AICA: fix sample addressing for the full 8 MB [kingshriek].

 * improved serial port timing
 * better infrastructure for adding more variants like DS5002
 * Fixed port reading
 * Rewrote Macros for better readibility
 * Fixed and rewrote Interrupt handling
 * Now returns INTERNAL_DIVIDER, adjusted cycle counts
 * Remove unnecessary and duplicated code
 * Remove unnecessary functions
 * Rewrite to have sfr-registers stored in int_ram. 
 * Debugger may now watch sfr-registers as well.
 * implemented interrupt callbacks (HOLD_LINE now supported)
 * Runtime switch for processor type - remove ifdefs
 * internal memory maps for internal rom versions (internal ram now 
    displayed in debugger)
 * more timer cleanups from manual
 * fix timer 2 interrupts
 * implement serial mode 2/3 rx and tx clock handling
