Enabled all CPU cores/variants. Fixed compile issue revealed as a 
result. [Aaron Giles]

Changed konami setlines callback to pass a device. Updated all drivers
accordingly. [Aaron Giles, Atari Ace]

Added best-known CRC in wb90b2 and jjsquawb "bad dump" roms. [robiza]

Made the PCI bus a device. The bus is declared in the machine config,
and the devices attached to it are enumerated there. Eventually, the 
PCI config read/write functions should be moved to well-known 
functions within the device, but for now they are kept separate.
[Aaron Giles]

Added correct proms for arkgcbl. [robiza]

Changed many, many global Machine references to use machine, 
device->machine, etc. instead. [Atari Ace]

Changed megadriv.c to pass running_machine to I/O callbacks plus other 
MESS support. [R. Belmont]

Re-synced f3853 core with MESS. [Nathan Woods]

Introduced function macros for SAMPLES_START, CUSTOM_{START,STOP,RESET},
and ANTIC_RENDERER. Pushed the running_machine * passing through these
functions. In other locations added "running_machine *machine = Machine"
to the top of functions to isolate the dependencies. [Atari Ace]

Added logic to track OSD debugger updates separately from internal 
view updates. In order to get the OSD to update, a new function 
debug_view_flush_updates() must be called. Currently this is 
automatically called before osd_wait_for_debugger(), and during the 
periodic updates while executing. The OSD code may occasionally need 
to call it under other circumstances (for example, the Windows code 
calls it explicitly while tracking scrollbar thumbs to get live 
scrolling). [Aaron Giles]

Updated gradius2 to use proper gfx2 roms (same values of vulcan but 
byteswapped). [robiza]

Disabled the use of PULSE_LINE for any input lines except NMI and 
RESET. Added a helper function generic_pulse_irq_line() for doing a 
single-cycle assert/deassert for those few drivers remaining that were 
trying to use PULSE_LINE directly. [Aaron Giles]

Updated z8000 tables to reflect recent findings. [Juergen Buchmueller]

Fixed the widely used konamiic/taitoic/deco16ic/segaic16 video cores
to no longer reference the global Machine. [Atari Ace]

Added wrappers for ADSP21xx callbacks. Added device parameters to them.
Updated IRQ setters to use generic_pulse_irq_line(). [Aaron Giles]

Added MDRV_PIC8259_ADD, MDRV_PIT8353_ADD, MDRV_PIT8254_ADD, and 
MDRV_DMA8237_ADD macros. [Wilbert Pol]

Added the sound device to the parameters passed to stream_create so 
that the global Machine can be removed from streams.c. [Atari Ace]

Improvements to Millennium 4000 driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Completed normal Inputs/Outputs.
 - Added button-lamps calculation.
 - Created button-lamps layout.
 - Documented the PCB RAM.
 - Fixed NVRAM size based on PCB picture (2x CY62256L-70PC near the 
    battery).
 - Added notes about the method to make appear the real poker cards.
 - Fixed the OKI 6295 frequency (1000 kHz resonator near). Now the 
    game has more decent sounds.
 - Corrected CPU clock to 12 MHz. (main Xtal).

Updated adp driver: now fashiong show something. [robiza]

Widened some machine init interfaces to pass the machine parameter, 
allowing more Machine global references to be eliminated. Eventually 
most of these need to be converted to devices, but this change reduces 
the deprecation surface in the meantime. [Atari Ace]

Relaxed the OKI 6295 command validity check. [Nicola Salmoria]

Added new function cpuexec_describe_context(machine) which can be
used in logerror() and other printf-style functions to return a
description of the current CPU/PC given only the machine. Changed
several dozen sites to use this instead of directly interrogating
the activecpu. [Aaron Giles]

Removed all other uses of activecpu throughout the system. Removed
activecpu from the machine structure to prevent future abuse.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed cpu_push_context() and cpu_pop_context(), and all call
sites. [Aaron Giles]

Voodoo devices now require a CPU to be defined in the configuration
in order to know whom to steal cycles from or stall when FIFOs get
full. Updated all voodoo users to specify one. [Aaron Giles]

CPD1869 devices now also require a CPU to be defined in the
configuration, in order to know which CPU's registers to fetch.
Updated all cdp1869 users to specify one. [Aaron Giles]

Removed get context/set context calls from the CPU interface entirely.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed safe_cpu_get_pc() which doesn't really make sense anymore.
[Aaron Giles]

Moved cpu_execute() to be an inline function. [Aaron Giles]

Writes to a pit8253 timer control word always restart the timer.
[Wilbert Pol]

Updated the fcompress APIs to allow for specifying a compression level.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed the concept of state saving tags, which was a hack to get save 
states to work with multiple CPU cores. Simplified the state saving 
system as a result, performing the operation in a single pass and 
without allocating a full blob of memory. Also enabled minimal 
compression. [Aaron Giles]

Squashed another deprecated use of Machine from the mame core by 
plumbing machine_config into rendlay.c. [Atari Ace]

Fix Altivec RGB primitives on newer GCCs. [budge, Vas Crabb]

Changed commonly-used verboselog to require a machine parameter.
[Atari Ace]

Removed remaining deprecat.h references from the CPU and sound cores.
[Atari Ace]

i8085: added INTE and state word callbacks [Curt Coder]

n8080.c changes: [Curt Coder]
 - rewrote interrupt handling according to schematics
 - added interrupt acknowledge

Re-ordered SCSP init to fix crash. [R. Belmont]

Modified regrep to display the soruce file. [Aaron Giles]

Expanded cpuexec cycles <-> attotime functions to handle UINT64s.
[Aaron Giles]

Reduced all alpha68k.c YM2413 clocks from 8MHz to 3.579545MHz.
[Philip Bennett]

Changed attotime_to_ticks/ticks_to_attotime to use UINTs and the 
eminline functions where possible. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the 6522 VIA implementation to be a device. [Nathan Woods]

Removed the ACIA6850 device from Cal Omega System 905 machine driver. 
It fixes the wrong lack of SW2. [Roberto Fresca]

Fixed EI handling in the 8080/85 core to have a shadow like the Z80.
[Miodrag Milanovic]

Modified the tms34010.h, pc16552.h, and tms34061.h interfaces to 
eliminate some more global Machine variables. Six more deprecat.h 
includes eliminated. [Atari Ace]

Eliminated the #include "deprecat.h" from tilemap.c. The main change 
is to require callers of tilemap_create to provide a machine pointer. 
This pointer is then attached to the tilemap and used when needed 
inside tilemap.c. [Atari Ace]

Eliminated the #include "deprecat.h" from drawgfx.h.  It does so in a 
fashion similar to my recent tilemap patch, adding the machine pointer 
to gfx_element, changing allocgfx to take a machine, and then 
adjusting the internals to use the machine field as needed. 
[Atari Ace]

i960: fixed nor opcode and added notor opcode [robiza]

Fixed raster effects in nbbatman by altering the V33 prefetch timing
(just a guess as no documentation has been found). [couriersud]

Removed unnecessary address masking in disassembly view. Changed 
console subview computations to leave the registers portion fixed.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed hack for setting mcs51 serial callbacks. Updated micro3d to 
use new functions. [Aaron Giles]

Merged goldstar.c & cmaster.c drivers. Converted the Reels video to 
tilemaps. [David Haywood]

Added proper artwork for the LEDs in Gridiron Fight. [David Haywood]
