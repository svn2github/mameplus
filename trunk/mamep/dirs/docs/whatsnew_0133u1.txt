Rewrite of NES PPU: [Robert Bohms]

 - Ported all rendering to access PPU address space through memory 
    map
 - Updated MAME drivers to install read handlers or memory banks in 
    PPU memory map, as appropriate.

NMK16 driver clean ups. Merged some of the duplicated code in nmk16.c,

[Brian Troha]

Clear screens. When set to "English" you simply see "Stage 'x' Clear" (where 'x' is the current stage you just finished).

Changed clocks on Trojan as verified on pcb. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Changed quake CPU speed to 233MHz, added basic PC IO map, hooked up 
8259, corrected year to 1998, added some TODO statements. [Luigi30]

Moved priority_bitmap from a global into the running_machine struct.
Updated all drivers accordingly. [Atari Ace]

Changed Scud Hammer analog controls from paddle to accelerometer. 
Previously, if you did nothing, the paddle control caused the hammer 
to smash automatically. [hap]

Verified and updated the vertical syncs on the following pcb:
[Corrado Tomaselli]
 - system18 motherboards
 - ninja ryukenden
 - tricky doc
 - raiden
 - Ninja Kid 2

 - tiger road
 - stv motherboard
 - toki
 - raiden 2 / raiden dx (same pcb)
 - cabal
 - blood bros
 - tengai
 - gng
 - rally byke
 - vimana

Fixed some inconsistencies with bootleg manufacturer names, eg. using 
Bootleg (big B), or using the original company if the rom is a 
bootleg. [hap]

Changed sound z80 of ghost and goblins from 3mhz to 1.5mhz as verified 
on pcb. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Documented lamps/motor usage for Night Striker [Angelo Salese]

Made irqs more accurate in City Connection [Angelo Salese]

Hooked up Cobra Command sound ROM. [Jim Hernandez, Aaron Giles]

Fixed cobram3 dip switch. [Xander]

Fixed a bug related to eating cycles during 68k cpu reset. Previously, 
initial_cycles had a wrong value after reset, and if cycles were < 0, 
it'd always return 0. This change also happens to fix a scrolling bug 
in Fantasy Zone, introduced when that cycle eating thing was added. 
[hap]

Calc 3 update: [David Haywood]
 - Shuffled a few things around based on new findings
 - Added an extra decryption table used for the Brap Boys startup code
    (still doesn't do anything interesting)
 - Noted that one of the unknown parameters for the MCU Init command 
    is where it reads / writes eeprom data from.
 - Noted that an additional parameter in the MCU commands may cause 
   further displacement of the writeback address, as BRap Boys seems 
   to rely on this (needs further testing) - added a hack for now so 
   that BRap Boys places the writeback address of the initial table 
   somewhere that causes it to get executed.

Marked graphics ROMs on Led Storm Rally 2011 (US) as bad, as they
cannot possibly be the right ones for this set. [David Haywood]

Properly added support for namcos2 multiple posirq anyway. Fixes
the following issues:[hap]
 - starblad polys
 - fourtrax track and mirror
 - dirtfoxj game start spotlight effect, game still locks up tho
 - burnforc 'hiccup' glitches when scrolling left/right
 - luckywld tunnel glitch (still a bit glitchy though)
 - finehour bad sprite colors
 
Changed vsyncs to the following games: truxton, demon's world, Pang, 
super pang, block block, yie ar kungfu and kikikaikai. 
[Corrado Tomaselli]

Corrected sn76459 clock to Ye Ar Kungfu and verified the other clocks.
[Corrado Tomaselli]

Changed the main clock of Pang, Super Pang and Block Block.
[Corrado Tomaselli]

Switched galaxian LFO sound to use the long-disabled NEW_LFO. It's not
entirely fixed, but it's closer. [hap]

Minor MCR documentation changes: [Kevin Eshbach]
 * Updated all of the TRON sets with location of the roms and the 
    board they belong to
 * Updated the name of the PROM on the Super Sound I/O board
 * Added notes about PALs that need to be dumped (The same PAL part 
    numbers are also  used on Xenophobe and probably other MCR II & 
    III games.)

Fixed chdman -update to leave the write protect state alone when 
updating uncompressed CHDs. [Michael Zapf]

Changed default key for Mahjong P1 Bet to '3', because '2' was 
conflicting with P2 Start in 2 players Mahjong games. [Fabio Priuli]
