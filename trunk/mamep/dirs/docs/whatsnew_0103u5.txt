MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
esb065gre [Mathis Rosenhauer]



Source Changes
--------------
Undid fix for turbofrc37b1gre since it broke more things that it
fixed. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed minor color issue in Cookie & Bibi. [David Haywood]

Updates to the Hyperstone core: [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
 - Removed nested delays
 - Added better delay branch support
 - Fixed PC seen by a delay instruction, because a delay instruction
    should use the delayed PC (thus allowing the execution of software
    opcodes too)

Hooked up watchdog for NeoGeo games and removed a number of hacks.
[David Haywood]

Fixed hanging at the end of level 3 in klondkp. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed inputs in Renju Kizoku, Neratte Chu, Mayjinsen 2 and some dips 
in Neratte Chu, Mayjinsen 2. [Sonikos]

Improved auto_malloc so it uses less memory and doesn't have a hard-
coded limit on the maximum number of allocations. Also audited the
use of auto_malloc in the code and removed unnecessary checks for
NULL (since auto_malloc doesn't return if it fails). [Atari Ace]

Fixed osd_fopen error reporting to return the correct value if you hit 
MAX_OPEN_FILES. [Nathan Woods]

Changed several byte operands in the i386 disassembler to be 
diassembled as unsigned rather than signed. [Nathan Woods]

Discrete sound updates: [Derrick Renaud]
 - Added new DISCRETE_CSVLOG module that lets you log discrete nodes 
    as CSV (comma separated values) data.
 - Modified discrete core to use the clock specified in the 
    MDRV_SOUND_ADD line.  If the clock is specified as 0, then the 
    discrete emulation will default to the audio sample rate clock.
 - Tweaked Phoenix Effect 2 sound to be more accurate matching 
    oscilliscope data.  Changed the Phoenix discrete clock rate to 
    a fixed rate of 120000 allowing the simulation to be more 
    accurate with less alaising noise at the cost of speed. 
 - Fixed the bug in the DISCRETE_NOTE module that produced notes 
    1 count off.

Added support for registers that are not to be displayed in the 
register list. This is useful for registers like AX on i386, so that
AX can be used in expressions but not represented on the register 
list. Simply precede the register name with '~' to prevent display.
[Nathan Woods, Aaron Giles]

Added support for the various x86 8-bit and 16-bit derived 
registers, as hidden registers in the i386 core. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed background music in ESB. Updated IRQ frequency and divider to 
match the schematics. [Mathis Rosenhauer]

Improved dip switches for rocktrv2. [Chaneman]

Separated the allocation of graphics data from the decoding. This fixes
the crashes that were introduced in u4, and will allow for decoding
progress to be reported eventually. [Aaron Giles]

Made a clean-up pass over all the makefiles. rules.mak is gone now,
replaced by cpu.mak and sound.mak. mame.mak has been reorganized. All 
the makefiles are now commented and should be easier to follow. 
[Aaron Giles]

Rewrote artwork scaling function to compute accurate sum over all
contributing pixels. This produces better results when scaling high
resolution artwork down to lower resolutions. Kept existing bilinear
filter for scaling low resolution art to higher resolutions. 
[Aaron Giles]



New games added or promoted from NOT_WORKING status
---------------------------------------------------
Hidden Catch (World) [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
Fortress 2 Blue Arcade [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]



New clones added
----------------
Several more NeoGeo bootlegs [Razoola, David Haywood]
Jumbo Ozaki Super Masters Golf (Japan) [Team Japump]
Miss Puzzle (Nudes) [Brian Troha]
