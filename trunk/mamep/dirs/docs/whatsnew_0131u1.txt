Source Changes
--------------
Deprecated device_set_info. Almost all devices had a NULL or empty 
function here. Remaining devices have been converted to have 
device-specific functions to do the same thing with proper type 
checking. CPUs still have a set_info function but it is CPU-specific 
now and no longer piggybacks on the general device function.
[Aaron Giles]

Changed UI to ignore selection from lightguns when off screen. This 
stops selection of Gun X Gun Y if you move the gun out of range.
[Derrick Renaud]

Moved stv_vdp2_dynamic_res_change() function outside of VIDEO_UPDATE 
in ST-V. [Angelo Salese]

Merged memory map and worked out some sound related stuff in Pass.
[Angelo Salese]

Hooked up standard paletteram16_xbgr() function instead of a custom 
one in sshangha.c driver. [Angelo Salese]

Replaced the use of CPU numbers with tags where possible across most
drivers. [Fabio Priuli]

hng64.c improvements / changes: [David Haywood]
 - Stripped out some old HNG64 code / some improvements
 - disabled the floor stuff in Fatal Fury Wild Ambition (looking for a 
    cleaner implementation)
 - disabled zooming code for the same reasons (it was causing many 
    issues)
 - understood and implemented the 'auto-animate' registers for the 
    tilemaps (animated waterfalls etc. in Fatal Fury Wild Ambition)
 - reorganized graphic decoding
 - documented + hooked up 4bpp/8bpp select on layers.
 - fixed tile flipping
 - fixed a bug in the hng64 dma

goldstar.c improvements / changes: [David Haywood]
 - added scroll registers for the girl when enabled in attract mode
 - documented how you can swap the blue/green bonus colours (but left 
    the code disabled, I think versions with it swapped probably just 
    have different proms)
 - added gfxdecode for cmasterc

Memory maps merges for the following drivers: [Angelo Salese]
 * groundfx.c
 * lastduel.c
 * macrossp.c
 * madmotor.c (also cleaned-up some video variables in it)
 * mcatadv.c (also reduced a 1.0 clipping out volume setting)
 * moo.c

Changed the way memory allocation is handled. Rather than allocating 
in terms of bytes, allocations are now done in terms of objects. This 
is done via new set of macros that replace the malloc_or_die() macro:

  alloc_or_die(t) - allocate memory for an object of type 't'
  alloc_array_or_die(t,c) - allocate memory for an array of 'c' objects of type 't'
  alloc_clear_or_die(t) - same as alloc_or_die but clears the memory
  alloc_array_clear_or_die(t,c) - alloc_array_or_die with clearing

All original callers of malloc_or_die have been updated to call these
new macros. If you just need an array of bytes, you can use
alloc_array_or_die(UINT8, numbytes). [Aaron Giles]

Made a similar change to the auto_* allocation macros. In addition,
added 'machine' as a required parameter to the auto-allocation macros,
as the resource pools will eventually be owned by the machine object.
The new macros are:

  auto_alloc(m,t) - allocate memory for an object of type 't'
  auto_alloc_array(m,t,c) - allocate memory for an array of 'c' objects of type 't'
  auto_alloc_clear(m,t) - allocate and clear
  auto_alloc_array_clear(m,t,c) - allocate and clear

All original calls or auto_malloc have been updated to use the new
macros. In addition, auto_realloc(), auto_strdup(), 
auto_astring_alloc(), and auto_bitmap_alloc() have been updated to 
take a machine parameter. [Aaron Giles]

Changed validity check allocations to not rely on auto_alloc* anymore
because they are not done in the context of a machine. [Aaron Giles]

Removed of SMH_BANKn macros. Just use SMH_BANK(n) instead, which is 
what the previous macros mapped to anyhow. [Aaron Giles]

Added missing casts and made other tweaks to appease some more strict 
settings on the compiler. [Aaron Giles]

Merged memory maps in the seta.c, sf.c, nbmj8688.c, megasys1.c

Modified my coin_insertion() function to use ASSERT & CLEAR instead 
of PULSE_LINE in cntsteer.c & ssozumo.c. [Angelo Salese]

Made sure that both the RESET and BUSREQ lines are honored by the 
megadriv sound cpu. [Wilbert Pol]

Add READY line readback to the SN76496 core, cleaned up the structs a 
bit, cleaned up comments, added more TODOs, Fixed some unsaved 
savestate related stuff. [Lord Nightmare]

Added sn76496 ready line hook-up for spcforce.c, doesn't make a 
difference since it's not actually used. [Angelo Salese]

Added RTC emulation for hng64 driver [Angelo Salese]

Fixed sprite trail for mnight and robokid [kanikani]

Factored out some more MESS specific code for Atari 8bit. 
[Fabio Priuli]

Splitted Naomi / Atomiswave memory maps and improved sorting of the 
driver. [Angelo Salese]

Added sound to Pocket Gal Deluxe (bootleg) [Angelo Salese]

lordgun - Fix: P1 Button2 is really P2 Button1. [Cananas]

Changed Lunar Lander thrust control to a pedal. This more accurately 
emulates the control. Note: the current code uses IPT_PADDLE. This 
causes the game to start with the thrust at 50%. This is not correct.
The control is really a hand operated pedal. [Derrick Renaud]

Merged memory maps for nycaptor, nbmj8991, nbmj8891, mystwarr. 
[Angelo Salese]

First layer of memory map merging for namcos2.c and namcos21.c, needs 
a second hand in order to remove all the SMH references (they both 
are macroized to hell). [Angelo Salese]

Fixed Yellow Cab (Japan) booting, promoted to working status 
[Angelo Salese]

Attempted to fix colors in Koi Koi Part 2 [Angelo Salese]

Lowered DAC volume in Karate Champ from 0.50 to 0.15, it was having 
sound clipping problems since day one. [Angelo Salese]

Cleaned-up HNG64 system ports. [Angelo Salese]

Changed the z80_bank_addr in megadriv.c into a simple 9 bit shift 
register. Fixes mantis 2817.  [Enik Land]

Improved interrupt handling for the 8/16 bit H8s. [R. Belmont]

System 23: hooked up serial comms between subcpu and I/O board.
[R. Belmont]

Added a driver for Irem M14 HW. [Angelo Salese]

Removed deprecat.h dependancy for kopunch.c. [Angelo Salese]

Naomi: hacked up 3D renderer. Still quite preliminary but allows most
games to show graphics. [Olivier Galibert, David Haywood]

Converted the WAVE sound device to stereo (for MESS). [Curt Coder]

Various improvements to Parent Jack driver. [Tomasz Slanina]

Modified mahjong games in Naomi to be loaded with a specific 
configuration, will add the proper JVS hook-up later. [Angelo Salese]

[Dr. Decapitator, Guru, Angelo Salese]

Fixed display of the i8085's SP register when in the debugger. 
[MooglyGuy]

Added proper MCU dump for Meikyuu Hunter G. 
[Dr. Decapitator, Guru, Angelo Salese]

Moved Taito 'skip to next level' buttons from BUTTON_2 to Q/W keys.
[Fabio Priuli]

Fix MCS51 disassembler to work properly when there are two memory
arguments (the second would overwrite the first). [Aaron Giles]

Added and began hooking up the 8751's for the System 1 games. Still 
some work to do. [Aaron Giles]

Added proper JVS I/O board init string for Idol Janshi Suchie-Pai 3 
to allow it to boot. [Angelo Salese]

Corrected sauro main cpu to 5Mhz and YM3812 to 2.5Mhz as verified on 
the pcb. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Improved protection emulation in galpani2 driver: [Luis Faria]
 - modified somewhat the protection handling, geeting rid of the need 
    to call galpani2_mcu_run from VIDEO_UPDATE, as that function is 
    performed by CPU2's INT7 and it now works. And added support for 
    command 2, making gp2se go into demo mode and allowing to go 
    ingame, nice skulls! ;-) Unfortunately, this set is still not 
    playable because of missing gals in the background and sometimes 
    there's an ADDRESS ERROR, causing a reset. Included in these 
    changes, I added support for MCU triggering by CPU2.
 - changed some 8 bit writes disguised as 16 bit to AM_WRITE8 and 
    AM_DEVWRITE8 and some AM_WRITE(SMH_NOP)s to AM_WRITENOP.
 - "crystallized" the clocks of the M68000s and OKIs, deriving the 
    latter from the former.
 - fixed a Copy&Paste mistake I made in the previous submission, in 
    the sound rom mappings for galpani2/2t/2g.
 - reduced the input port definition duplication by using PORT_INCLUDE 
    where applicable instead of defining everything again.
 - reduced the CPU#2 Code region size to the effectively used size, 
    and expanded the CPU#2 Backgrounds Data region size to the maximum 
    usable size, making it the same for all sets.

Fixed bug when setting breakpoints on Z80 CPUs at addresses A-F.
