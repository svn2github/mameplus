OSD porters take note of the changes to the OSD core routines.



Source Changes
--------------
Added save state support to the tubep driver. [Svante Gerhard]

Added save state support to the steppers module. [James Wallace]

Added the remaining input pins to the SN76477 Interface. If these 
pins are constant, they can now be defined in the structure as 
opposed to having to call functions in an init routine. Modified all 
the drivers that use a 76477. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Removed file I/O functions from osd_tool.h in favor of the ones in
osdepend.h. Updated tools accordingly. Added new flag
OSD_FLAG_CREATE_PATHS to the open command. [Nathan Woods]

Moved OKIM6295 pin 7 state (internal divider) to internal structure. 
Updated all drivers to specify pin state when setting the interface. 
Added comments for all cases where the original frequency wasn't / 132 
or /165 as the real pin state is unknown. [David Haywood]

Updated Toki driver to display visual DIPs for the game.
[Brian Oberholtzer]

Added sprite X flip and removed unneeded hack in wheelfir driver.
[Tomasz Slanina]

Fixed several issues with the new Unicode support. [Nathan Woods]

Changed uimenu.c to allow displaying DP switch banks which have 
gaps (unused switches) in them. These switches are now grayed out.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Another Amiga update: [Ernesto Corvi]
 - Fixed blitter in line mode
 - Modified Copper to run on odd memory bus cycles
 - Fixed screen delay offset when display data fetch is not word 
    aligned

Fixed cheat searching. [stephh]

Replaced CPS2 CHDs with preliminary decryption function.
[Andreas Naive, Nicola Salmoria]

Added code to validate that banks are only set to point to memory
that has been allocated via auto_malloc(). Currently disabled
pending further review. [Nathan Woods]

Updated input port tokenization for MESS. Added support in MAME
for "configuration" switches which are separate from DIP switches.
These can be used to configure aspects of the game that don't
correspond to DIP switches. Modified pacman.c to use configurations
to control the speedup options. [Nathan Woods, Aaron Giles]

Fixed invalid array access in the taito_l driver. [Atari Ace]

Made a fix minor compiler compatibility tweaks to the source.
[Atari Ace]

Fixed several glitches and crashes related to the input port and
unicode changes from u2. [Aaron Giles]

Separated "core" OSD function definitions to osdcore.h. Added more
extensive documentation. [Aaron Giles]

Created a new library called osdcore, which is now built and linked
to each executable. Moved all definitions of expected components of
osdcore into new header file osdcore.h, and added consistent
documentation for them all. Removed osd_tool.c, and moved the 
necessary parts of its functionality into osdcore. [Aaron Giles]

Defined a new set of interfaces for osdcore which creates an
abstract interface for queueing work items to be potentially executed
on a secondary thread. Implemented the Windows versions of these
routines, but have not done any testing yet. [Aaron Giles]

Separated Windows OSD core routines into individual files, as
folows:
  windir.c  - directory-related core OSD functions
  winfile.c - file-related core OSD functions
  winmisc.c - miscellaneous core OSD functions
  winsync.c - synchronization-related core OSD functions
  wintime.c - timing-related core OSD functions
  winwork.c - threading-related core OSD functions
[Aaron Giles]

Created new osdmini directory with minimal implementations of all the 
OSD core routines. These can be used to stub in functionality or as
a starting point for new ports. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up chdman, normalizing its behavior and improving error
reporting. [Aaron Giles]

More updates to the laserdisc emulation, based on more complete
understanding of how the discs are encoded and how they will 
eventually be stored. [Aaron Giles]
