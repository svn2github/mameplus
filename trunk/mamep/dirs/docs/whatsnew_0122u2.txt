Source Changes
--------------
Fixed M65C02 optimization. [Peter Trauner]

TMS51xx and M58817 speech updates: [couriersud]
 - radarsc1 uses tms5110 speech synth
 - cvs games: according to PCBInfos speech chip is TMS5100.
    Changed driver to use TMS5100 and "game system operational" now 
    sounds more natural
 - removed sound/m58817.*
 - added support for multiple coefficients maps to tms5110.*
 - added coefficient maps for TMS5100 and M58817 from documented 
    sources to tms5110r.c
 - fixed interpolation factors (see tms5110r.c for reason)
 - made lattice calculation precision 9bit
 - added support for READBIT and LOADADDRESS commands to tms5110.c
 - more changes in line with various patents
 - documented TRS-02, TKG-02/03 "voice" interface

Completed the addition of static qualifiers to all MAME symbols that 
aren't explicitly exported. [Atari Ace]

Named the input_seq_type enumeration and used it explicitly in several
places. [Nathan Woods]

Corrected tx1 and tx1a coinage DSW assignments. Reversed buggyboy/
buggybjr 'Game Time' settings. [Philip Bennett]

TMS3203x core updates: [Aaron Giles]
 * fixed interrupt handling
 * added support for edge-triggered interrupts on '32
 * expanded interrupt support for the '32
 * updated drivers using TMS3203x core to deassert interrupts
 * added externally accessible functions for converting '3x floating point 
    format
 * updated gaelco3d driver to use new functions

Zeus2 (+related) updates: [Aaron Giles]
 * fixed save states for DCS games
 * cleaned up Zeus2 waveram handling
 * added Zeus2 save state support
 * added preliminary model and quad rendering support for Zeus2
 * added support to timekpr for the ZPRAM used on Zeus2
 * hooked up ZPRAM in Zeus2 games
 * hooked up controls in Zeus2 games
 * updated poly.c to ensure it is idle before saving state
 * Added artifical Z offset of -2 to make the full screen show in crusnexo

Replaced tekken2/tekken2a/tekken2b 'tes1wave.8k' ROM with the 
correct, non-byte-swapped dump. [Philip Bennett]

Added discrete 74LS624(56789) implementation [couriersud]
 - DISCRETE_74LS624 is a VCO needed for dkongjr
 - Supports Logic, Energy and Count outputs

dkong updates: [couriersud]
 - Added dkongjr discrete sound
 - Proper interface Z80 - I8035 for dkongjr
 - Changed discrete sound output factors
 - removed samples support for dkongjr
 - Cosmetic changes
 - Fixed regression in radarscp sound
 - Added dipswitch locations to dkong3b

Documentation and clock frequency improvements for seta.c: [Brian Troha]
 - Added the Guru's readme info for Thundercade
 - Corrected rom name for Thundercade
 - changed clocks to OSC by divider IE: 16000000/2 /* 8MHz */
 - Changed Orbs clock to 16MHz with note about 14.xx MHz
 - Changed Meta Fox's x0-006 (65c02) to same as Thundercade
 - Changed the YM3438 in Ultra Toukond Densetsu from 6MHz to 1600000/4 
    /* 4MHz */ as there is no mention of 6MHz OSC on PCB

Verified a number of clock frequencies from real PCBs.
[Corrado Tomaselli, Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed several memory leaks related to SCSI CD emulation.
[Oliver Stoneberg]

Removed the increasing of the R register from each IX/IY related 
(FD xx or DD xx) instruction on the Z80. According to documentation
and the behavior of the Amstrad CPC driver, this is incorrect.
[Barry Rodewald]

Added initial FPU support to the SH4 core. [Samuele Zannoli]

Adjusted most conditional logging in MAME to use the idiom 
"do { if (VERBOSE) logerror x; } while (0)". This has the benefit that 
the compiler checks the syntax of the logging even in the case it will 
be eliminated, and in fact a number of cases here needed adjustments 
to compile because of this. [Atari Ace]
