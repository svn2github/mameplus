Source Changes
--------------
Added notes to several drivers indicating specifically that an MCU
is needed for decapping. [Angelo Salese]

Naomi renderer: add all 64 blending modes, and made it anal-retentive 
where it comes to position precision. [Olivier Galibert]

Converted Irem M14 HW to tilemaps and cleaned-up the driver.
[Angelo Salese]

Renamed yumefuda.c/hanaroku.c drivers to albazg.c/albazc.c (like they 
should be properly named). [Angelo Salese]

Added MCU no dumps for the Grand Striker driver. [Angelo Salese]

Fixed background colors in Alien Command. [Angelo Salese]

Added profile markers to naomi, to see what % of cpu time things are 
using. [David Haywood]

Lowered the AY-8910 volumes in the adp driver. [Angelo Salese]

Some Maple fixes, now Street Fighter Zero 3 Upper should be fully 
playable. [Angelo Salese]

Added cart info documentation update for the two resent Mega-Tech cart 
dumps: Shadow Dancer & Streets of Rage. [Brian Troha]

Merged memory maps in the following remaining drivers and cleaned up 
some comments: homedata.c, intrscti.c, inufuku.c, irobot.c, jack.c, 
kaneko16.c, naughtyb.c, scobra.c, scramble.c, slapfght.c, spaceg.c.
[MooglyGuy]

Fixed Naomi bug in computedilated, was causing bad portraits in 
shikgam2. [David Haywood]

Removed second parameter from MDRV_CPU_PROGRAM_MAP, MDRV_CPU_DATA_MAP,
and MDRV_CPU_IO_MAP. For the remaining drivers that used multiple
address maps, converted them to use AM_IMPORT_FROM to import the base
map. [Aaron Giles]

Added bilinear filtering to Naomi video emulation. Textures are still 
a bit crawly since we're always using the lowest MIP level. 
[MooglyGuy, Aaron Giles]

Short-circuit the naomi rendering in non-textured cases, prevents a 
lot of bad graphics. [David Haywood]

Fixed tubepb regression. [Fabio Priuli]

Added MC-8123 key for Gigas. Of course the game still doesn't work 
because the program ROM is missing. [Nicola Salmoria]

Applied some of the Naomi exclusive texture mode rules. 
[David Haywood]

Added a work-around for the UART FIFO read only status register on the 
SH-4 to make Tetris Kiwamemichi happy to boot. It crashes shortly 
after that like La Keyboard though (jumps to an unmapped address).
[Angelo Salese]

Hacked the Naomi YUV interrupt to fire when the base register is 
written.  (Currently looking at implementing properly, but this 
prevents KuruCham and SS2005 from hanging). [David Haywood]

Converted namcos2.c, niyanpai.c and nbmj9195.c to use AM_IMPORT_FROM
instead of macros. [Angelo Salese]

Fixed regression for mitchell.c games. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added MCU no-dump to Air Buster. [Angelo Salese]

Commented out the ACIA irq, was causing missing bgms in Street 
Fighter Zero 3 Upper. [Angelo Salese]

Improved the debugging on the Naomi Wave DMA handler. [Angelo Salese]

Converted DJ Boy memory maps to current standards. [Angelo Salese]

Fixed pipedrm tag problem. [Fabio Priuli]

Fixed ninjakd2 DIPSW and notes. [kanikani]

Fixed a couple of bugs in cave.c and seta2.c introduced with the
memory map merges. [Fabio Priuli]

MCS-51 fixes: [Aaron Giles]
 * jb int0,<self> loops are now broken out of if int0 comes and is 
    taken
 * externally-clocked counters only count when enabled
 * internal RAM no longer wraps when accessed out of bounds

System 1 changes: [Aaron Giles]
 * hooked up 8751 properly
 * removed old 8751 hacks
 * shuffled Shooting Master sets

Fixed tattass regression from map merging. [Fabio Priuli]

Fixed P2 palette write handlers for fromancr and fromanc4. 
[Fabio Priuli]

Fixed halleys.c sound: ay8910 write handlers work on two bytes.
[Fabio Priuli]

Marked polystar, hellngt and totlvice CHDs as bad. Will be replaced 
soon. [Guru]

Added missing YMZ280B ROM to evilngt/hellngt. [Guru]

Fixed regression on homedata.c driver. [Angelo Salese]

Fixed Legend of Makai regression. [Angelo Salese]

Removed "BAD_DUMP" from the Red Baron AVG bprom, it has been verified 
correct (contents and label) by the Dumping Union. [Smitdogg]

Improved the single board 4p mode in Kick N Run / Mexico 86. It 
basically works but 2p mode is broken so I still keep it as disabled 
by default. [Angelo Salese]

Fixed Kiki Kai Kai exception. [Angelo Salese]

Dumped io board rom to Dynamic Golf. [Guru]

Fixed King Derby sprites wrap-around and flip x positioning.
[Angelo Salese]
