MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
- 01017: [Sound] nslasher: The music stops at some points in the game

         DIP's 4,5 and 6 ("COMM Setting") (Fabio Priuli)



Source Changes
--------------
Cleaned up and remapped Big 10 inputs. Updated the game notes. Added 
other minor changes. [Roberto Fresca]

Improved the sound in Double Wings by appling the same handling of 
Night Slashers (they are actually similar if not same memory map) 
[Angelo Salese]

Fixed scrolling layer in Magic's 10 [Angelo Salese]

Added NO_DUMP for the H8/330 MCU for Magic's 10 2, Super Pool, Hot 
Slot and Magic Colors. [Angelo Salese]

Several discrete sound refinements, mainly targeted at mario:
[couriersud]

 * Use formula derived from figures 2 and 3 in LS624 datasheet. 
   Coefficients were calculated using least square approximation.
   This approach gives a bit better audible results compared to the 
   prior approach.

 * Fixed energy calculation for LS624

 * Use energy values as input for XOR. This seems to better reflect 
   the superimposition of the two signals. On the long term, both 
   LS629 and the XOR need to be converted into a custom module to 
   properly model mixing if the two frequencies are close to each 
   other. 
  
 * Adjusted C41 to 60% for skid sound.

Fixed the remaining CPS3 sets that were left broken from the previous 
half-done set renames. Also reworked the code a bit to make it harder 
for somebody to break it in future (removed the config table & moved 
keys to driver inits, define region sizes, allocate memory in init 
for CD based games.) Should be no functional changes, although it 
might be a fraction of a % faster due to there being less region 
lookups. [David Haywood]

Added preliminary sound for the Aero Fighters bootlegs (aerfboot & 
aerfboo2) [Angelo Salese]

Added some 'new fruit bonus '96' sets, unsure what they are.
[David Haywood]

Added a mess of sets marked as 'time dog' to the goldstar driver. 
These seem to be mismatched, and some lack program roms. One set has 
encrypted code, the other appears to have plain code. These will need 
some tidy-up work. I've added them, because there is no doubt at 
least one valid set in here but the dumps contain no useful info at 
all. [David Haywood]

Preliminary protection hook-up for Sexy Gal/Sweet Gal [Angelo Salese]

Fixed colors, visible area and soft resets in the Magic Card 68k 
version. Started to convert the Magic Card 68k version driver with 
proper infos & added some basic video registers. It actually runs on 
more or less modified Philips CD-i architecture. [Angelo Salese]

Imported Archimedes code from MESS. [R. Belmont]

Fixed foreground tilemap colors in Diamond Derby [Angelo Salese]

Added new module devcb, which can generically handle conversions 
between device read/write functions and various other types of 
functions. Introduced new structures and macros to make this possible:
[Aaron Giles]

  To take advantage of this, a device must change its interface to 
  replace any read/write callbacks with the new devcb_read/write 
  structures. During device start time, the device then uses this new 
  devcb module to resolve the information in the devcb_read/write 
  structures into a more efficient form. When the device needs to call 
  one of the callbacks, it uses the inline devcb_call_read/write 
  functions.

  Once a device has defined its callbacks as devcb_read/write 
  structures, users of the device must use the DEVCB_* macros to 
  specify the type and information about the handler to use:

    DEVCB_NULL = no handler
    DEVCB_HANDLER = a standard device read/write handler
    DEVCB_MEMORY_HANDLER = a memory address space read/write handler
    DEVCB_DEVICE_HANDLER = a device read/write handler for a different 
                             device
    DEVCB_INPUT_PORT = an input port

Converted the 8255PPI device to use this new structure, and updated all 
users to use the DEVCB macros, removing some unnecessary trampoline 
functions along the way. [Aaron Giles]

Added calculation for caps >= 100pf to buck rogers LS626 frequency 
calculation. Formula was derived from figure 6 of LS624/628/629 & 
625/626/627 datasheet. "BUCK ROGERS" is now centered and big ship 
appears centered over br's ship. [couriersud, Guru]

Converted 6821new device to use devcb. Updated Williams drivers to
remove trampoline functions. [Nathan Woods]

Improvements to norautp.c driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Merged GTI Poker (gtipoker.c) with this driver.
 - Added new memory map and machine driver for gtipoker.
 - Hooked 2x PPI 8255 to gtipoker.
 - Hooked the video RAM access ports to gtipoker.
 - Changed norautpn description from Noraut Poker (No Payout),
   to Noraut Poker (bootleg), since the game has payout system.
 - Some clean-ups.

Fixed encryption in Cabaret and added sound emulation [Mirko Buffoni]
 - Moved to a separate driver
 - Not fully playable, press reset to exit from pitfalls

Implemented a few more H8/3xx instructions, and added funcube to 
seta2.c [Luca Elia]

Added a default backup ram for the jolyc980 set, to get it boot to 
the end-user. [Angelo Salese]
