IMPORTANT CHANGE FOR OSD DEVELOPERS: osd_logerror is no longer
used. Rather, for error logging you provide a handle to a mame_file
in the options.logfile field. If you leave this set to NULL, no
logging will be done.

Source Changes
--------------
Fixed hyhoo which was broken in the last round of changes.
[Takahiro Nogi]

Added emulation of the Alpha 8201/8301 MCU, and connected it to
champbbj, champbb2, talbot, shougi, shougi2, and exctsccr.
[Tatsuyuki Satoh]

Added cpunum_set_clock_period(), a variation of cpunum_set_clock() 
that takes subseconds_t, providing better granularity. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed most of the remaining issues in Wink, though there is still
some unemulated protection.
[HIGHWAYMAN, Nicola Salmoria, Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added save state support to the galaga.c and segaybd.c based games.
Improved the "out of context" error message to indicate the source 
of the problem. [Andre Hufschmidt]

Moved logerror handling into the core. OSD ports should set 
options.logfile to a mame_file handle for the output file. 
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed second SN76496 on Congo Bongo to have the correct frequency.
[Aaron Giles, Chris Law]

Hooked up Sega Universal Sound Board to Pig Newton. [Aaron Giles]

with a proper errorcode. [Aaron Giles]
