Source Changes
--------------
Additional CDP1802 updates, taken from MESS. [Curt Coder]

Fixed colors in One + Two. [Tomasz Slanina]

Made the PowerPC dynarec options runtime configurable. [Ville Linde]

Added save state support to the hatris/pipedrm driver. [couriersud]

Corrected Moustache Boy main cpu interrupt rate, main cpu clock freq, 
and screen refresh rate according to measurements on a real PCB.
[Tormod Tjaberg]

Separated the DECO and Mitchell games in the simpl156 driver and added
more extensive documentation. [Brian Troha]

Fixed analog controls in Solar Assault. [Ville Linde]

Changed the options code so that ranges are specified on the 
option_entry structure, and enforced when option values are changed.
[Nathan Woods]

Further improved the ROZ layer emulation in the K001604. [Ville Linde]

Konami ZR107 update: [Ville Linde]
 - Fixed sound hardware check in Winding Heat
 - Changed to use the correct tilemap chip type
 - Hooked up analog controls
 - Fixed texture rom loading and texture decoding
 - Improved the 2D tilemaps

Introduced a mame_options_exit() call to complement 
mame_options_init(). [Nathan Woods]

Added a mame_fopen_options() call, similar to mame_fopen() but with 
the ability to specify a core_options object to use. [Nathan Woods]

Improved noise emulation in the SN76496 emulator. Added several
variants which differ based on the noise generator and other
parameters. [Lord Nightmare]

Changed all plot_pixel and read_pixel calls to BITMAP_ADDRXX macros.
Removed the now-obsolete functions. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added support for aliasing sound types. This allows minor variants in
sound cores to share the same fundamental "type" so that the same
sndti_* functions can be used regardless of the subtype. [Aaron Giles]

Changed location of save state files. Now they are placed in the
<savestate>/<gamename> directory. Auto-generated save state files have
the name "auto.sta". All other save state files are named <slot>.sta.
