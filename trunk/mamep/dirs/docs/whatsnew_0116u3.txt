MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------


Source Changes
--------------
Simplified CPS3 decryption function. [Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed potential double free in PNG code. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed warnings generated by newer gcc compilers. [R. Belmont]

General driver cleanups: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 - changed some more global ‘Machine’ to local ‘machine’
 - standardized on the function name ‘draw_sprites’
 - removed some antiquated boilerplate comments

Updated FM emulator to use mame_time instead of double. Removed old
neogeo hack from FM code as it appears to no longer be necessary.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Updated all sound cores to use mame_time instead of double.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Populated several more Irem CPU opcodes for gussun. [robiza]

Fixed CPS3 code to work on big-endian systems. [R. Belmont]

Fixed code_to_token() to prevent potential buffer overflows.
[Atari Ace]

Fixed crashes in non-working drivers dynablsb and driveyes.
[Atari Ace]

Changed all CPU cores’ internal timers to the mame_timer* functions 
as well as the remaining couple of core files that still used 
timer_alloc(). After this, none of the emu/* files have any old style 
timing code left. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Various CPS3 updates as documented on Haze's blog. [David Haywood]

Fixed type in BLENDER2_32 function in the n64 video code.
[Christophe Jaillet]

Created a new resistor network interface for computing palettes from
color PROMs and component values on the PCB. Fixed several issues
with the previous implementation. [couriersud]

Donkey Kong driver update: [couriersud]
 - added sprite ram bank switching from schematics
 - combined memory maps
 - first attempts on decoding m58815
 - radarsc1 driver for radarscope trs01 hardware
 - all drivers use VIDEO_RAW now
 - fixed cocktail issues
 - combined io and sound memory maps
 - implemented background handling (disable prom /CS line) in all 
    dkong drivers

Extended the flt_rc filter to support highpass filtering. Fixed the
lowpass filter to actually do a lowpass filter. Hooked up the filter
to King & Balloon and updated several other drivers to the new
interface. [couriersud]

Added support in the main makefile for profiling. Set PROFILE=1 to
turn this on. [Christophe Jaillet]

Updated djboy driver to almost fully playable state.
[Phil Stroffolino]

Temporarily reverted input code back to 0.116 baseline pending deeper
analysis and upcoming core changes to simplify the OSD layer for input
management. [Aaron Giles]

Changed a number of stderr fprintf's in the Windows OSD code to
mame_printf_error and mame_printf_warning calls, as appropriate.
