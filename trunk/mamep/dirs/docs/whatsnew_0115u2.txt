Source Changes
--------------
Merged in a couple of minor tweaks from MAME Plus! [MAME Plus!]

Fixed China Gate high scores. [Robbert]

Fixed Final Lap R/Speed Racer graphics. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added a new opcode for Match It 2. There still are 4 unknown opcodes 
and the "no tiles" bug before it will be promoted to working status.
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Changed the CRTC6845 emulator to optionally control the screen 
configuration and video rendering. Updated the Qix and Spiders driver 
to use the new functionality. Added notifications for when the
display enable pin changes in order to drive blanking signals.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

New 74123 timer emulator. It supports different ways a 74123 can be 
hooked up that affect the timing period. The old implementation was 
incorrect in lots of respects. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Removed the addressing order parameter from pia_config() and replaced
it with dedicated write and read handlers. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Rewrote nyny driver: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 - Game speed should now be correct. It was way too slow before
 - Added star field. The game can stop and reverse the direction of 
    the star field by changing a delay counter
 - General driver clean-up
 - Fixed DIP switches and the voices

Fixed bug in win_get_window_text_utf8() for when a window's text is 
an empty string. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed some page 1 opencode lengths in the 6309 dissasembler.
[Tim Lindner]

Added DIP switches to Master Boy according to the game manual.
[ClawGrip]

Added DIP switch information to the Poizone driver. [Luigi30]

Changed png2bdc to support multiple input PNGs. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed recently introduced bug in Astrocade driver relating to
collision detection. [Aaron Giles]

Added support for controlling the default scale/offset for screens
at the driver level. This allows us to properly describe the screen
width/height and blanking in the driver independent of specifying a
good default size to crop the image to. [Aaron Giles]

Added border support to the Astrocade driver. Extended the starfield
generation out into it. Extended the blanking region out farther to
match information from the flyers and set the default scale/offset
of the games to crop appropriately. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed the CDP1869 to fill the border area with the background color.
Added cropping to the Cidelsa games. [Aaron Giles]

Corrected speaker locations and placement for Gorf and Wizard of Wor.
Added missing mux to Gorf's audio, which controls speech versus
sound effects during the game. [Aaron Giles]
