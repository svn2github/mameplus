bwidow, mhavoc, omegrace. [couriersud]

Device-ified the Atari mathbox. [couriersud]

Device-ified the Atari vector generators. [couriersud]

Added register SXFER (0x05) to the 53c810 - Nothing more. This reg 
determines SCSI transfer speeds. scud / scuda now fatalerror with 
writes to reg # 0x70. [couriersud]

Added mtonic decryption. [Olivier Galibert]

Provided color prom to Cow Race [Tomasz Slanina, Angelo Salese]

Quick hack to delay installing the spu dma handler until the first 
write to the spu as driver init is now called after the devices are 
created. [smf]

XTAL and divisors for rocnrope verified in schematics. [couriersud]

Added a debug viewer for the blitter-based gfxs in the itgambl3.c.
[Angelo Salese]

Added a debug viewer for the blitter-based gfxs in the itgambl2.c.
[Angelo Salese]

Renamed a number of commonly-used but confusing device tags. The plan
is to move away from generic names like "main" to names that capture 
the device type as well. This will allow searches for devices to be
based on tags alone. Added validity checks to prevent the continuance 
of this pattern (which I started :), and to ensure that all devices
have unique tags, regardless of type. [Aaron Giles]

  Changes:
    CPU/"main" -> "maincpu"
    CPU/"audio" -> "audiocpu"
    CPU/"sound" -> "soundcpu"
    SCREEN/main -> "screen" (since it's the only one)
    SPEAKER/"left" -> "lspeaker"
    SPEAKER/"right" -> "rspeaker"
    SCREEN/"left" -> "lscreen"
    SCREEN/"right" -> "rscreen"
    SCREEN/"middle" -> "mscreen"
    SCREEN/"center" -> "cscreen"

Corrected rom names in tnzs.c for older TNZS sets. [Brian Troha]

Hooked up the reel background colour writes to cherry master / new 
fruit bonus '96 etc. [David Haywood]

Fixed rom loading in secretab. [Angelo Salese]

Added BellFruit Scorpion 1, Bellfruit System 85, Maygay M1B and 
Maygay M2 systems from AGEMAME. MPU4 Mechanical improvements have been 
made, making mpu4.c the mechanical driver, and mpu4drvr the non-
mechanical one. This only leaves JPM impact (mechanical skeleton), 
Maygay M2 and MPU3 (mechanical skeleton) to be ported from the 
AGEMAME codebase. There's also been a cleanup sweep on Scorpion2, we 
were declaring too many versions of the same function, and the reel 
drawing code had stopped working. Both of these are now fixed.
[James Wallace]

Lamp Output. [Derrick Renaud]
