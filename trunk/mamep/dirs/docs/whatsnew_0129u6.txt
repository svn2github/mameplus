Source Changes
--------------
Added built-in layouts for a large number of games: 280zzzap, 
buggyboy, buggychl, cbombers, changela, chasehq, chqflag, contcirc,
dblaxle, finallap, grchamp, hotchase, lagunar, outrun, overdriv,
pdrift, polepos, radr, roundup5, sci, slipstrm, stocker, superchs,
topspeed, toutrun, turbotag, tx1, wecleman. [Mr. Do!]
 
Merged memory maps in nemesis.c. [Aaron Giles]

Scramble now is a lot closer to reports and recordings (background 
sound, sound of bullets). [couriersud]

Fixed descriptions of the games running on NAOMI series hardware,
and NAOMI game list. [Yasuhiro Ogawa]

Input ports clean-up for the jangou driver. [Angelo Salese]

Finally low pass filtering on channel 2A in btime driver: [couriersud]
 * Changed resistor to bill of material value
 * Adjusted volume level and added more documentation

Fixed regression (missing graphics) in ipminvad (m10). [couriersud]

Added support for System 24 tilemap linescroll modes. 
[Olivier Galibert]

Various improvements to Heavy Unit:
   [Angelo Salese, Tomasz Slanina, David Haywood]
 - Added a VERY preliminary simulation of the protection, just enough to get the game to boot, not make it playable
 - Corrected CPU communication, IRQ/NMI generation etc.
 - Fixed some video emulation issues (added tilemap scroll etc.)
 - Corrected GFX rom loading (at least for the graphics used in attract mode)

Fixed King Derby sprite colors [Stefan Lindberg, Angelo Salese]

Merged tetrisp2 memory maps. Renamed teplus2->tetrisp2j. [Aaron Giles]

Merged labyrunr memory maps. [Phil Bennett]

Added GAME_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS to Tutankham & clones. [couriersud]

Hooked up layer enables in goldstar.c driver, fixes 'girl' in Cherry 
Master. [David Haywood]

Scaled up renegade and mjkjidai ADPCM levels in line with recent 
clock_adpcm() change. [Phil Bennett]

Converted all drivers to the new device-based 6821 PIA. [Aaron Giles]

Added new function memory_install_read_port_handler() to more
easily allow you to install read handlers for ports based on tag.
[Aaron Giles]

Removed input_port_read_handler8/16/32/64 functions, since they
were really only used for getting a memory handler for a port by
tag, and this is no longer necessary. [Aaron Giles]

Moved input port handlers to internal code in the memory system.
[Aaron Giles]

Added port names to the taito8741 device pending its proper
devicification. [Aaron Giles]

Removed all remaining uses of input_port_n_r() functions, and
purged them from src/emu/machine/generic. [Aaron Giles]

Removed device types from device queries that use tags, under the
assumption that all device tags are unique. Specifically, the
following no longer need to provide a device type:

   AM_DEVREAD/WRITE
   DEVCB_DEVICE_HANDLER
   devtag_get_device
   devtag_reset
   device_list_find_by_tag

as well as several device interfaces that referenced other devices.
[Aaron Giles]

Moved SH2 set info functions to direct calls. [Aaron Giles]

Various improvements to the Zero Target / Counter Steer HW and 
cleaned-up the driver. Fixed foreground & background colors and 
hand-tuned sound in Zero Target based on a side-by-side test.
Fixed sprite colors. [Angelo Salese]

Fixed pedals in Final Lap 3. [Phil Bennett]

Hooked up correct C75 MCU in namcofl.c (based on RB's namconb1.c 
implementation) [Phil Bennett]

Corrected Dip-Switch settings for Zero Target.
[Yasuhiro Ogawa, Angelo Salese]

maketms: Free strings on exit. [Olivier Galibert]

tms57002 - don't abort on unimplemented instructions. 
[Olivier Galibert]

Changed eeprom erase command to write 0xff values. 
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Fixed handling of corrupt archives: [couriersud]
 * corrupt files in archives now generate an error
 * archive files ending in "/" will not be tested for crc - skip path entries
 * add new flag FILE_OPEN_NO_PRELOAD to skip decompressing on open
   This is used in audit.c, which only tests whether files exist
 * added error checking to all calls to load_file_zipped

Added flags to the CHD metadata entries, encoded in the top bit. Right 
now it is a no-op, but eventually will be used to indicate which bits 
of metadata are included in the overall checksum. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed gcc 4.4 compilation error. [Belegdol]

Fixed auditing of ROM-less systems (for MESS). [Rene Reucher]

Another round of static/const qualifier additions, plus a rename of 
has_addon_chip to snes_has_addon_chip.  Notably a number of 
z80ctc_interface are now const (devicification must have removed the 
cases where it was dynamically modified). [Atari Ace]

Added the correct gfx roms to jjsquawkers bootleg. [David Haywood]

sfbonus version cleanups part 1. [David Haywood]
