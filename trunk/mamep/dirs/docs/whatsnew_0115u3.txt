Source Changes
--------------
Fixed PIA numbers in revamped Spiders driver. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Updated TIA graphics code is the code from the MESS repository. Also
updated tourtabl driver to accommodate the changes. [Wilbert Pol]

Fixed Space Firebird so that the sprites are opaque with respect to 
each other and bullets, but transparent with respect to the star 
field. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed subtle behavior in handling of PIA port A. This allows for the
removal of hacks in the Qix driver and the Williams driver.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Cleaned up the tilemap get_info callbacks: [Atari Ace]
 * regularized and clean up the existing callbacks
 * changed some callbacks to use int tile_index as the parameter
    so that all callbacks use consistent naming
 * folded some direct uses of tile_info.flags into calls to 
    SET_TILE_INFO()
 * changed the Konami drivers to manipulate the tile_info global only 
    within the tile_get_info callbacks
 * replaced all the callback declarations with TILE_GET_INFO() 
    wrappers 
 * changed the interface to pass tile_info as a parameter and made
    tile_info a static variable only accessible inside tilemap.c.

Significant changes to the berzerk driver: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 - Video timings, memory map and interrupt system implemented from 
    schematics
 - Hooked up colors according to the schematics as well. The colors 
    changed significantly. For example the yellow robots are now 
    more like a mustard color.

More ARM wrestling: [R. Belmont]
 - Fixed error in carry propagation on ALU opcodes of the form 
    ALU r1, r2, r3 SHIFTEROP #imm
 - Fixed Thumb ADD instructions where the PC is involved
 - Fixed LDMIA to mask off bits 0 and 1 of the destination address
 - MSR instruction now properly respects processor mode and field 
    code flags

Modernized the Beam Invaders, Clay Shoot, and Embargo drivers.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Changed the sound balance in Thunder Dragon 2 to match the original 
PCB. Also verified the 68000 clock. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Fixed several more opcodes in the encrypted Irem CPU. [Robiza]

Fixed disassembly of brset and brclr opcodes in the 68HC11 core.
[Phil Skuse]

Fixed tilemap colors in the Konami ZR107 driver. [Ville Linde]

Fixed bug in INR/DCR opcodes in 8085 CPU core. [allentown_john]

Updated PIA interfaces to support masks for port A/B inputs. This
allows proper behavior of unconnected pins, according to the specs.
Updated a number of games to use the new interfaces. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed bug that failed to initialize all IRQ states in the 6809 core
on a reset. Also fixed cycle timing and removed obsolete code from
the core. [Ernesto Corvi, Zsolt Vasvari]

Cleaned up vec_mult implementation. [Nathan Woods]

Improved toratora driver: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 - added SN76477 from the schematics, but it sounds terrible; no doubt 
    the schematics are incorrect in many places
 - updated to the recent PIA changes

Fixed input.c to use osd_ticks() instead of clock(). [Nathan Woods]

Fixed bit calculation in 6526cia.c which broke joysticks in the C64
driver in MESS. [Pete Rittwage]

Improvements to the rd2tank driver: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 - fixed colors, based on the Red Tank flyer
 - added AY8910's, sounds fine, but how exactly they are hooked up 
    to the PIA is not fully understood.
 - hooked up CRTC properly
