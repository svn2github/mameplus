0.104u5
-------

IMPORTANT CHANGE FOR OSD DEVELOPERS: a new function 
osd_create_directory is now required in order to create memcard
subdirectories. This function was previously defined only for the
MESS core, so if there is a MESS port already available, you can
just import that function.

Source Changes
--------------
Hooked up missing language jumper in the Psikyo 4 games.
[David Haywood]

Added board notes to the Namco System 12 driver, hooked up the light
gun in Ghouls Panic/Point Blank 2, and emulated Tekken Tag Tournament 
DMA protection (still not playable). [Olivier Galibert, Duddie, smf]

Fixed old debugger compilation on non-Windows platforms. Added
mame_strnicmp along the way. [Lawrence Gold]

Fixed compile errors under GCC 4.1. [Lawrence Gold]

Changed the NES PPU interfaces to follow new struct conventions.
[Nathan Woods]

Updated disassembly comments support: [Andrew Gardner]
 - fixed a 0-length comment bug (no more "// 0, " allowed)
 - added comment output to the new debugger's dasm command
 - changed the comment save path from /mame/comment to /mame/comments

Added new debugger properties: logunmap, logunmapd, logunmapi which
enable/disable logging of unmapped memory accesses. [Nathan Woods]

Added save state support to the Astrocade driver. [Adam Bousley]

Some small improvements to the Polygonet Commanders driver.
[Andrew Gardner]

Preliminary Thumb implementation for the ARM7 core. Many opcodes 
present, but there are definite sign problems. [Ryan Holtz]

Hooked up ARM7 protection CPU in KOV2. Boots but does not run or 
play due to the Thumb sign problems. [R. Belmont]

Fixed incorrect flags emulation in the 8080 CMA instruction.
[Kopromaster]

Added support for zero-length palettes (requires RGB direct mode) and
several validity checks related to display variables. [Nathan Woods]

Updated windows input code: [Derrick Renaud]
 * Now using RAWMOUSE mode if available. This means you can now use 
    multiple mice in Windows XP. Lightgun support has not been 
    changed yet.
 * Added back DX7 support for the windows input system to support 
    multiple mice. It was set to DX5 in 104u2.
 * Removed the system mouse from the list of available mice on 
    non-XP systems. This allows you to now properly select the 
    individual mouse.
 * Modified the Analog Axes selection of the player controls to be 
    more responsive.

Cleaned up video system in Scorpion 2 driver. [El Condor]

Converted asterix to use K056832 emulation. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Reduced encryption in Gaelco games down to equations. These still 
need to be optimized, but the giant encryption tables are no longer 
needed. [Nicola Salmoria]

Cleaned up include files in CPU/sound cores. CPU cores should 
generally only need to include cpuintrf.h. Sound cores should
generally only need to include sndintrf.h. [Atari Ace, Aaron Giles]

Fixed bug that caused a full set of validity checks even on release
builds. [Aaron Giles]

New debugger features: [Aaron Giles]
 * new command "print" is a simple way to display the result of one 
    or more expressions
 * new command "symlist" displays all the symbols registered
 * all save state registered scalar globals are now available as
    symbols (prefixed by a '.')
 * all save state registered global arrays are now available for
    viewing/editing in the memory window
 * all registered memory regions are also available for viewing/
    editing in the memory window

Made it a fatal error to request operations on invalid sound/CPU
indexes. These have been logged to the error.log in the past, but
really need to be cleaned up. Added a new function 
safe_activecpu_get_pc() that can be used when logging PCs to smartly
detect whether or not it is safe to call activecpu_get_pc().
[Aaron Giles]

Changed CPU init/reset callbacks. The init callback now accepts a
number of parameters, including the CPU index, the clock, a generic
configuration parameter, and a pointer to the IRQ callback. The reset
callback no longer takes any parameters (the configuration parameter
has been moved to the init callback). And the IRQ_CALLBACK getter/
setter has been removed since this is now set up once at 
initialization time. [Aaron Giles]

Added mame_get_phase to determine which program phase (init/reset/
running/exit) the system is in. This is intended primarily for
assertions to enforce rules about when certain actions can be taken.
[Aaron Giles]

Rewrote winalloc to be more dynamic, and to ignore memory leaks in
the runtime. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed memcards properly. They are no longer hardcoded for the neogeo.
The implementation has moved to generic/machine.c, and a callback
handler very similar to NVRAM is now supported in the machine driver
definition. Cards are created per-game, so the memcard directory now
has a subfolder per game with each game's cards stored underneath.
[Aaron Giles]
