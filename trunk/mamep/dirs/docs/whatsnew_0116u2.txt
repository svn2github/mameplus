Source Changes
--------------
Fixed regressions in Gridlee and Gomoku. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed some unicode build issues in the Windows code.
[Oliver Stoneberg]

Updated a number of games to correctly use the SN76489 instead of the
SN76496, which was a later design. [Justin Kerk, Lord Nightmare]

Cleaned up the exports from a number of drivers, adding static
qualifiers to functions and variables t hat don't need to be exported
and have generic sounding names. [Atari Ace]

Updated numerous drivers to remove the use of global Machine wherever
possible. Also reviewed the clipping regions and made changes to
ensure the passed-in cliprect was honored. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Cleaned up the Dooyong driver: [Vas Crabb]
 * Consolidated and streamlined tilemap callbacks
 * Took better advantage of MAME's tilemap caching by building 
    larger tilemaps so they don't need to be invalidated as often
 * Interpreted sprite Y position as signed 9-bit value in 
    rshark/superx (fixes some glitches)
 * Added more explanatory comments to help others reading the code 

Changed a number of mame timer objects from void * to mame_timer *.
[Atari Ace]

Fixed a couple more Irem CPU opcodes to improve Match It 2.
[Robiza]

Fixed collision detection bug in thunderX. [Shimapong]

Initial cut at working CPS3 driver. Basically works but has a lot
more work to be done to finish it up.
[David Haywood, Andreas Naive, Tomasz Slanina, ElSemi, Philip Bennett]

Fixed minor cycle timing issue in 6809 CPU core. [Ernesto Corvi]

Neo-Geo updates: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 * Fixed several regressions from previous update
 * Added LED outputs
 * Improved smaller visible area configuration

Fixed some incorrect information in the Neo Geo ROMsets. [JohnBoy]
 
Integrated platform-specific changes into the core makefile, mostly
taken from the SDLMAME makefile. Changed the MAMEOS configuration
variable to OSD, indicating which OSD layer is being compiled. Added
a new configuration variable TARGETOS which specifies the target OS 
platform. [Aaron Giles]
