Source Changes
--------------
Fixed colors in loverboy. [David Haywood]

Fixed buffer overflow in K054539. [BUT]

SCSP improvements: [kingshriek]
 - Added logarithmic envelope table
 - Set envelope level to start at 0x17f in the ATTACK state 
    (0x3ff-0x280) as per Neill's notes 
 - Changed EG_SHIFT from 8 to 16 - more precision is needed to 
    differentiate the longer decay envelope times 
 - In the DECAY1-->DECAY2 transition, changed the "<=" to "<"
 - Decreased the output of the effect out mixer a bit
 - Fixed unaligned 16-bit samples
 - Prevented keyoffs from killing slots when already in the release 
    state 
 - Envelope steps in the attack state are apparently exponential. To 
    account for this, I change the envelope output to linear for 
    attacks.
 - Change the release rate calculation to use the decay table instead 
    of the attack one.

Fixed uninitialized variable in h6280 core. [Wilbert Pol]

Added meter support to the Cobra games. Cleaned up some of the 
steppers code. [James Wallace]

Const-ified a number of data structures in the MAME system. 
[Atari Ace]

Added PowerPC 604 processor support. Moved PowerPC opcode tables to 
the CPU context to allow multiple simultaneous processors with 
different opcode tables. [Ville Linde]

dkong driver updates: [couriersud]
 - Added configuration switch to change palette between TKG02 
    (radarscp conversion) and TKG04 (dkong 2board)
 - Added speech support (samples) to radarsc1
 - Fixed sound for drakton and strtheat
 - Hooked up and written 8257 dma controller
    All dkong and dkongjr based games now use the 8257
    All epos and 2650 based games now use the 8257
 - Fixed 2650 games to use dkong audio as well - only cpu replaced 
    by addon board ...
 - Updated game flags and added missing rom entries
 - straightened memory maps
 - Fixed bug in dkong3b memory map
 - Externalized sound drivers to MACHINE_START in audio/dkong.c
 - DAC Filter now uses lowpass sallen key filter
 - Reorganized INPUT_PORTS
 - Added Dip-Switch locations to 8ballact
 - Fixed 8ballact according to conversion manual 
 - Reorganized code

Corrected a potential issue if more than one 8039/8035 is used by 
a driver. Also should fix a potential inconsistency between saving 
and loading a state. [couriersud]

Added an assert to ensure that the sound clear latch value is only
set at init time, since its value is not saved. [Aaron Giles]

Modified src2html to sort by filename rather than assuming that the
osd file finding routines would do so. [Aaron Giles]

Fix memory system regression caused by recent optimization. Fixed
another bug uncovered as a result in the decrypted opcode management.
[Aaron Giles]

More Zeus improvements. Converted over to 64-bit data and simplified
the logic to work more like the hardware. [Aaron Giles]
