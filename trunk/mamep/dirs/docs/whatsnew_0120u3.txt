Source Changes
--------------
Cleaned up the inline assembly for both x86 and PPC, enabled the 
mul32 family assembly stuff on 32-bit x86, and fixed some compiler 
warnings on 64-bit GCC. In addition: [Vas Crabb]
 * Provided single-precision reciprocal approximation code for 
    PowerPC and x86 with SSE2.
 * Filled in all other TBD functions in eigccx86.h for completeness.
 * Conditionalised some code in eigccppc.h so that it isn't used 
    when the compiler has 64-bit instructions available.

Added static qualifiers and renamed symbols in MAME in an effort 
to further tidy up the global namespace. Generally generic names were 
targeted and some symbols that were both static and extern. Some
specifics: [Atari Ace]
 * K053247_ram was made static throughout and the existing 
    K053247_export_config was used to obtain the value in xmen.c.
 * The enums DS1991_STATE and DSP_TYPE were unused and were therefore 
    removed. 
 * Dead code in cps3.c and thayers.c was discovered and commented out.

Made almost all input port definitions static. [Aaron Giles]

Obsoleted the GAMEB macro, which is no longer necessary. [Atari Ace]

Fixed casting issues in new inline validity checks. [R. Belmont]

Some build-related improvements to the sound cores: [Atari Ace]
 * The SCSP dependency on mame/drivers/stv.c was removed allowing it 
    to built independent of the driver.
 * The WAVE dependency on MESS code was made explicit, so it can be 
    built independentally of MESS. 
 * VOTRAX can now be built independentally of SAMPLES.
 * The YM2612 core now can be built without including the YM3438 core.
 * Unnecessary uses of BUILD_ and HAS_ macros have been removed.
 * BUILD_ instead of HAS_ macros are used in 3812intf.c for 
    consistency with the other fm cores.

Added DIP locations to several SSV games (in ssv.c). [Vas Crabb]

Corrected some errors in the SH4 core and implemented store queues 
and the basics of DMA. Added a call to simulate dma transfers with 
external devices. [Samuele Zannoli]

Expanded polynew.c to support quad rendering. Converted midvunit.c
over to using the new quad rendering, which fixes a number of 
rendering issues that have plagued the driver since the start.
[Aaron Giles]

Added Z-clipping logic to polynew.c. Converted namcos22 over to using
that code. Simplified namcos22 significantly, working in quads
throughout the lower-level pipeline and then handing the results off
to polynew.c. [Aaron Giles]

Updated model3.c to use the new poly code, and changed much of the
low-level implementation to make things easier. [Aaron Giles]

Defined a couple of new functions in eminline.h: atomic_increment32
and atomic_decrement32. [Aaron Giles]
