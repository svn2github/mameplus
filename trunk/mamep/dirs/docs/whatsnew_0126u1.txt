0.126u1
-------

NOTE: The cheat engine is disabled as of this version. It is 
currently undergoing a desperately-needed complete redesign and 
rewrite from scratch. By the time 0.127 is ready, we should have
support for the vast majority of existing cheats working once
again.

Source Changes
--------------
makemeta changes: [Aaron Giles]
 * Split out Manchester code parsing into a separate utility module.
 * Rewrote Manchester code parsing to be clock based.
 * Updated makemeta to call the new functions.
 * Changed makemeta to parse a different format for metadata.
 * Fixed Huffyuv decompression in aviio.
 * Added more robust logic to parse out the white flag.

Newest Japanese Naomi BIOS added [batman2509, starke/peap]

pit8253 updates: [Wilbert Pol]
 - Changed the implementation to use timers internally.
 - Removed the frequency change callbacks.

slapfght driver update: [stephh]
 * Renamed sets :
    - tigerh2  -> tigerhb1 ("Japan set 2"   -> "bootleg set 1")
    - tigerhb1 -> tigerhb3 ("bootleg set 1" -> "bootleg set 3")
    - gtstarba -> gtstarb1 ("bootleg set 2" -> "bootleg set 1")
    - getstarb -> gtstarb2 ("bootleg set 1  -> "bootleg set 2")
 * "Performan" :
    - cleaned/fixed Dip Switches and added port locations
 * "Tiger Heli" :
    - added MCU simulation for 'tigerhb1' (in fact, I only had to 
       return the correct value for the hardware test as there 
       doesn't seem to be any other communication - I'm still not 
       convinced that this bootleg had a MCU)
    - cleaned/fixed Dip Switches and added port locations
    - added notes with the differences between the different sets
 * "Get Star" / "Guardian" :
    - added MCU simulation for 'getstar' and 'getstarj' heavily based 
       on 'gtstarb1' bootleg
    - cleaned/fixed Dip Switches and added port locations
    - added notes with the differences between the different sets 
       (and especially detailed the numerous ingame bugs in 
       'gtstarb2')

Added new module uiinput.c which manages input for the user interface.
The OSD is responsible for pushing mouse events and character events
to this interface in order to support mouse movement and text-based
input (currently only used for the select game menu). Added support
for navigating through the menus using the mouse. 
[Nathan Woods, Aaron Giles]

Redesigned the UI menus so that they can maintain a richer state. Now
the menus can be generated once and reused, rather than requiring 
them to be regenerated on each frame. All menus also share a comment 
eventing system and navigation through them is managed centrally. 
Rewrote all the menus to use the new system, apart from the cheat 
menus, which are now disabled. Reorganized the video menu to make it 
easier to understand. [Aaron Giles]

Converted UI startup screens to use astrings. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed edge case in the DRC front-end that would incorrectly tag the
end of a sequence as "return to start" even if the last instruction
did not abet the starting instruction. [Aaron Giles]

Replaced the crazy number of get/set functions for render containers 
with a single get/set of a user settings struct. [Aaron Giles]

merged exctsccr.c into champbas.c. [Nicola Salmoria]

UDRC-based SH-2 dynamic recompiler: [R. Belmont]
 - All games on all drivers should work as before except "colmns97" 
    and "stress" which crash due to sound system trouble.
- All idle skips are still included. They are quite a bit less 
   effective than they were on the interpreter, but they still give a 
   boost.
- Fast RAM bypass is not included yet so this does not represent 
   final performance. That said, it's consistently faster than the 
   interpreter even now. Example: sfiii3 on 0.126 gets 609% on the 
   interpreter and 961% on the DRC.

Added ST-V BIOS info based on text at 0x800 (byte swapped). 
Reorganized the BIOS list & description. Added the USA bios to 
smleague and it's a USA only cart. [Brian Troha]

Added save state suport to Konami CPU & Aliens. [Nicola Salmoria]

Moved kodb to fcrash.c (which will probably end up being the home of 
the cps1 bootlegs). [David Haywood]

SH-4 update [Samuele Zannoli]
 - Fixed TRAPA and some versions of FMOV
 - Improved disassembly for MOV.W, MOVA, MOV.L, FIPR, and FSCA.

Fixed memory leak in romcmp. [Nicola Salmoria]

Merged memory maps in the cabal driver. [Nicola Salmoria]

i960: respect the rounding mode for CVTRI [ElSemi]

Corrected g13knd wave ROM 0 offset. [Philip Bennett]

Fixed cocktail sprite position in galaxian.c. Fixes that the frog 
disappears for player 2 if moved backwards. [couriersud]

Changed direct access EEPROM interface to return the "bus width" of 
the EEPROM data, and the size is in terms of units, not bytes. 
Updated all drivers accordingly. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the ROM loading code to actually alter the region flags based
on the CPU endianness and bus width when creating the region, rather
than fixing them up on the fly. This means that callers to
memory_region_flags() will get the correct results. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the expression engine to use two callbacks for read/write 
rather than relying on externally defined functions. [Aaron Giles]

Expanded memory access support in the expression engine. Memory 
accesses can now be specified as [space][num]<size>@<address>. 
'space' can be one of the following:

   p = program address space of CPU #num (default)
   d = data address space of CPU #num
   i = I/O address space of CPU #num
   o = opcode address space of CPU #num (R/W access to decrypted opcodes)
   r = direct RAM space of CPU #num (always allows writes, even for ROM)
   e = EEPROM index #num
   c = direct REGION_CPU#num access
   u = direct REGION_USER#num access
   g = direct REGION_GFX#num access
   s = direct REGION_SOUND#num access

The 'num' field is optional for p/d/i/o/r, where is defaults to the
current CPU, and for e, where it defaults to EEPROM #0. 'num' is 
required for all region-related prefixes. Some examples:

   w@curpc = word at 'curpc' in the active CPU's program address space
   dd@0    = dword at 0x0 in the active CPU's data address space
   r2b@100 = byte at 0x100 from a RAM region in CPU #2's program space
   ew@7f   = word from EEPROM address 0x7f
   u2q@40  = qword from REGION_USER2, offset 0x40
   
The 'size' field is always required, and can be b/w/d/q for byte, word,
dword, and qword accesses. [Aaron Giles]

Added World Rally support to tiny.mak/.c. [Macareno]

changela input improvements: [RansAckeR]
 - DIP switch fixes
 - Added DIP locations.

Minor srmp5 update: [Sonikos]
 - Removed hack in drive machine R3000
 - Adjusted  R3000 frequency to 25 Mhz according to speglsht 
    (the hardware is the same)
 - Adjusted visible area (but i'm not sure it's correct)
 - Fix one rom loading

Changed partial refresh policy in snk68.c and updated comments.
[Nicola Salmoria]

More conversion to input_port_read(): [Fabio Priuli]
 * converted to use tagged inputs and handlers all drivers starting 
    with S & T
 * simplified input reads in system24 (removing a redundant handler)
 * cleaned up a bit inputs in system 16 & 18 bootlegs (among the 
    other things, now coinage and P2 inputs in fpointbl & fpointbj 
    work again)
 * removed a lot of redundant #define from taito drivers, replacing 
    them with PORT_INCLUDEs and definitions from taitoipt.h
