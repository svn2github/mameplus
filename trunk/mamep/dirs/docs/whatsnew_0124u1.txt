Source Changes
--------------
Renamed galaxian.c -> galaxold.c. Updated all drivers accordingly.
[Aaron Giles]

Cidelsa driver updates: [Curt Coder]
 - de-deprecated the timer callbacks
 - moved PCB RAM to the heap and fixed index overflow
 - converted CDP1869 to the new device system
 - refactored to represent how the hardware actually works
 - added PMA latching on OUT5
 - separated Cidelsa video to its own file

COP CPU updates: [Curt Coder]
 - implemented interrupt
 - implemented serial input/output
 - fixed XAD/LDD, XIS1, RMB3 opcodes
 - fixed clock divider
 - fixed internal memory map size
 - added some cpu variants
 - fixed serial timer
 - fixed clocks
 - fixed COP410 RMB3, XAD instructions
 - general cleanup

Fix cfg file corruption if joystick is not connected; itemclass now 
part of token if item is not found. Settings for joysticks which use 
a custom item id will still be lost. A fallback has to be provided 
here since those will use a token generated from the input item name.
[couriersud]

Memory system changes: [smf]
 * Now passing mem_mask to the read and write debug hooks. This 
    allows the address & size of the memory access to be correctly 
    calculated when using a memory call that takes a mem_mask.
 * New macros added for checking mem_mask. ACCESSING_BITS_m_n, 
    These check for any access within the bounds between bit 'm' and bit
    'n' (counting bit 0 as the least significant bit). Currently the 
    pattern for checking whether both bytes of a word is written is to 
    make two byte checks.
 * All occurrences of ACCESSING_LSB, ACCESSING_MSB, ACCESSING_LSB16, 
    ACCESSING_MSB16, ACCESSING_LSB32, ACCESSING_MSB32, 
    ACCESSING_LSW32, ACCESSING_MSW32 & simple mem_mask checks have 
    been replaced with the new macros.

Added fatal error if AM_READ_PORT() references a non-existent port.
[Aaron Giles]

Converted special-case DIP switches (service, unknown, unused) into 
their own token type rather than expanding into other tokens. The 
reduces the number of redundant strings and data. [Aaron Giles]

Galaxian rewrite. Ultimately will combine the existing drivers
for galaxian, scramble, frogger, scobra, amidar, and dambustr.
For the moment, only a subset of games are implemented in the
new system; the remainder are running on the old code. Main features 
are accurate video timing, correct stars implementation, better 
organization, simplified input ports, and many other smaller fixes.
[Aaron Giles, stephh]

Minor cleanup and simplification in the video and palette code. 
Removed palette_config(). [Aaron Giles]

Fixed interrupt handling and 16-bit memory accessors in 6840ptm.c.
Also cleaned up code for the sake of readability. [Philip Bennett]

Added multiplier (same as wecleman) to Flak Attack. Info provided by 
VU801qCf. [Yasuhiro Ogawa]

Namco NA1 improvement: [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
 * Fixed sprites shadow in namcona1 driver and removed Emeraldia hack.
 * Added tilemaps and sprites 4bpp mode
 * Added preliminary ROZ implementation (disabled until the enable / 
    disable register is found)
 * Changed background pen to fix emeralda demo

Discrete sound system improvements: [couriersud]
 * Added DISCRETE_RCFILTER_SW to discrete sound. This implements 
    multiple RC networks with CD4066 switches to connect/disconnect 
    capacitor.
 * Implemented discrete mixing in circusc using DISCRETE_RCFILTER_SW
    and sound routing to route 76416 output to discrete logic. 
 * Added discrete filtering and mixing to galaxian.c games using 
    konami_sound.
 * Fixed timing of stream_update in discrete_sound_w. All sound 
    cores update before processing changed data.
 * Added streeam_update to discrete_sound_r
 * Now supports multiple output nodes per module. 
    In this case, NODE_XXX is the default output. Alternative outputs 
    may be accessed by using NODE_XXX_YY where 00<Y<08.
  
    You may also access nodes with macros:
  
      NODE_XXX = NODE_SUB(XXX, 0)
      NODE_XXX = NODE(XXX)
      NODE_XXX_YY = NODE_SUB(XXX, YY) with YY != 00 
      
    This should e.g. make discrete sound emulation easier when dealing 
    with e.g. flip flops (Q & QQ) and binary counters.
 * Added sanity checks to check consistency issues introduced by this 
    change
 * Modules specify number of outputs ==> Certain special modules 
    (WAVELOG) may no longer be used as input nodes
 * Removed explicit (NODE_XX + expr) from a couple of drivers

Fixed encoding/decoding of negative denormal floats in the AICA/SCSP
DSP. Shouldn't actually affect any games. [kingshriek, Deunan Knute]

Changed Seibu sound CPU to use AM_READ_PORT("COIN") instead of 
input_port_0_r. [stephh]

bloodbro.c driver improvements to DIP locations and coin modes.
Added notes for 'bloodbra'. [RansAckeR, stephh]

Add input ITEM_IDs for additional axes and switches. Also added 
ITEM_IDs for up to 4 hats/POVs. [couriersud]

Merged memory maps for half of the W drivers. Also made a couple of 
random touchups for X, Y, and Z drivers. [Andrew Gardner]

Added a little magic to make the Atomiswave BIOS try to be more 
verbose, but our video emulation isn't good enough to cooperate.
[R. Belmont, ElSemi]

Added bootleg of badlands - heavily modified, not working.
[David Haywood]

Fixed DS2401 state loading now that the digital i/o board's serial 
number has been changed to a const by not saving it. As the serial 
number cannot be changed at run time it was rather pointless. [smf]

BFCobra improvements: [Anonymous]
 * Added plane priority to blitter, fixing Treble Top signature 
    writing
 * Video output now supports all modes - lores, hires, mixedres, 
    8/7/4/3 bits/pixel, fixing Every Second Counts colour problems
 * Added line draw, fixing missing stuff from Question Of Sport
 * Change blitter loop type control - there are 4 types of loop.
 * Corrected video frame rate to 50Hz.
 * Corrected Z80 speed to 5.91mhz
 * Accounted for Z80 cycles stolen during a blit operation. Improves 
    gfx/sound sync and seems to fix the final round lockup in Every 
    Second Counts.

Various SCSI devices register state items by their disk ID, which are 
not unique across device types. Introduced a device-type offset for 
CD-ROMs so their registrations don't clash with harddisks. 
[R. Belmont]

Fixed tilemap viewer to draw the whole tilemap when categories are 
used. Added new option TILEMAP_DRAW_ALL_CATEGORIES to do this
efficiently. Updated several drivers to use this instead of rendering
each category independently where appropriate. [Nicola Salmoria]

Added DIP locations to blueprnt.c [RansAckeR]

Fixed ledutil.c so it compiles cleanly under MSVC. [Mike Haaland]

Astrocade update: [Dirk Best]
 - Update src/mame/includes/astrocde.h to use an XTAL value
 - Clear interrupts if they are no longer valid
 - Add the knob inputs

Added new makefile flag VERBOSE which enables gcc's verbose output
during compile. [Marc Sandusky]

Corrected clocks on Rygar. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Changed "Machine" to "machine" in a number of places when the 
running machine parameter is already available. In some cases this
also allowed for the removal of deprecat.h. [Oliver Stoenberg]

Did some major cleanup and gutting of pcshare.c. [Wilbert Pol]

Created a built-in overlay for Armor Attack using just rectangles.
[Mr. Do!]

Added dynamic control of RX and TX pins to 6850 ACIA emulation - this 
is needed for correct operation of the MPU4 Video communications 
system, and may be handy for some MESS systems. To use, set the rx 
and tx clocks to 0 in the acia interface, then use acia_tx_clock_in() 
and acia_rx_clock_in() respectively. [James Wallace]

Added proper implentation of hardware collision in mermaid. This 
fixes mermaid (when the player is in the water with the sharks) and 
rougien. Also fixed priorities in mermaid and rougien and a sprite 
wrapping bug. [Robiza]

Fixed CPS1 background color. This fixes 3 wonder (game start) and 
mtwins (explosion during attract). It seems to break Varth, however, 
and has dubious effects on the boot sscreens of avsp, sfa3 and 
possibly other CPS2 games. [Nicola Salmoria]

Added discrete filtering and mixing to ironhors. One driver less 
using FILTER_RC. [couriersud]

Fixes for aerfboot (bootleg of aerofgt): [Robiza]
 - fixes spriteram3 (previous value was too high and in the "city" 
    level some build disappear
 - sprite gfx bank (previously some sprite appear right and some 
    sprite was wrong)
 - fixed perfectly the sprite zoom
 - removed multisprite support; in the bootleg aren't present

Converted the pit8253 implementation into a device. To make it  
easier to use I've also created a src/emu/devconv.h in the same style
as src/emu/memconv.h. [Wilbert Pol]

Replaced anonymous timer in tx1 with an allocated one to make state
saving closer to reality. [Hugh Allen]

Changed winwork.c from using hand-built scalable locks to using
standard Windows CriticalSections for now, to hopefully address
