Source Changes
--------------
Added a lot of new clones to multfish and cleaned up the driver. 
[Vampirz, Fabio Priuli, Brian Troha]

Further ROM name fixes and driver name changes [Yasuhiro Ogawa]
 - renamed digdugb to digdug1 (it's a rev1, not a bootleg)
 - renamed digduga1 to digdugat1

SNES Updates: [Angelo Salese]
 - Fixed direct color gfxs in mode 7
 - Fixed direct color gfxs in mode 3/4
 - Fixed a vram out-of-bounds bug
 - Fixed a blending bug involving main/sub color maths
 - Fixed interlace mode gfxs when not in gfx modes 5/6
 - Fixed a GDMA boundary bug
 - Made the OAM address reset more accurate.
 - Fixed HDMA mid-frame inits.
 - Added clip colors to black window function
 - Converted color clipping to use struct entries
 - Made dynamic H resolutions to be called only at vblank start and and fixed gfx mode switching 1/5 and 5/1
 - Made the gfx mode switches more accurate.
 - Corrected a bunch of SPC registers behaviour
 - improved joypad read/write handling and fixed a serial port quirk.
 - Fixed serial port for player 2 as well
 - Improved cart mode 20 reserved access behaviour
 - added OBJ interlace support

ST-V: Improved timer 1 irq behaviour. Pebble Beach still have issues 
with gameplay start though (writes lots of garbage for whatever 
reason, really worked for random chances before). [Angelo Salese]

Corrected name from Devil's Island to Devil Island. Filled in year 
for Fruit Bonus 2006 SE & Bug Fever. [Brian Troha]

Discrete sound update: [couriersud]
 - removed global variable discrete_current_context
 - discrete_info is now passed instead of device, we may get device by
    using disc_info->device
 - Added DISCRETE_IMPORT(*block): imports another discrete block
 - Added DISCRETE_REMOVE(node1, node2): removes a range of nodes
 - Added DISCRETE_REPLACE: next node replaces existing node, thus 
    preserving run order
 - Added DISCRETE_NOP(node): does nothing, to be replaced.
 - Added a prescanning stage to build final block list after execution 
    of the above.
 - The additions provide an easy way to document subtle difference 
    between boards. 
 - Please see audio/galaxian.c for an example

Galaxian sound updates: [couriersud]
 - Moon Cresta and Galaxian now have their respective schematics 
    emulated, i.e. Moon Cresta has a slightly different mixing stage.
 - Cleaned up driver, added some section titles and comments, removed 
    old code.
 - Removed emu_timer, this was causing a stream of stream_updates only 
    updating 3 samples
 - Replaced with discrete timer module DSS_TIMER now.
 - Use DISCRETE_NOTE for pitch generation; it is more accurate 
    (within the one ms where the pitch changes :-) ) and saves a node
 - Use DISCRETE_BITS_DECODE and save 2 nodes.

YM2612/3834 updates [Eke-Eke, Nemesis]
 - Split YM2612/3834 to a separate file to avoid disturbing other OPN 
    chips
 - SSG-EG, envelope, LFO, and CSM behavior all improved to better 
    match tested behavior on real YM2612 chips
    
DSS_COUNTER updates: [couriersud]
 - clock_node no longer needs to be static for DISC_CLK_IS_FREQ
 - rewrote inc/dec logic to avoid loop

Added DISCRETE_BIT(S)_DECODE: [couriersud]
 - decodes individual bits from input values
 - Updated drivers which had macro DISCRETE_BITSET (which was a bit 
    misleading)
 - This should be slightly faster than using DISCRETE_TRANSROM

Discrete sound enhancements: [couriersud]
 - Put some life into RCDISC5 enable mode. This now acts as a switch 
    between R and C. Capacitor voltage will be preserved if disabled.
 - Made galaxian use the above. Saved 2 nodes and increased accuracy.
 - Added DISC_LFSR_FLAG_OUTPUT_SR_SN1 flag to shift register noise 
    generator. This will output the value of the shift register to 
    sub-node 1. This is needed for future bzone discrete sound 
    emulation. BTW: RCDISC5 will be used as well. 
 - Left a note on RCDISC3 on what is needed to be implemented for 
    bzone.
 - Optimized the LFSR a bit. LFSRs running at high frequency 
    (> sample_freq) should benefit.

Verified and fixed deniam.c M68K, Z80, YM3812 and OKIM6295 clocks 
and OKI pin 7 for logic pro and logic pro 2.  Fixed visible area on 
logic pro and logic pro 2 to match real PCBs. Add comment about what 
ym3812 clone is used. Add note about missing graphical effect in 
logic pro (screen dim on coin insert) and marked as 
IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS. Add note about 4 pixels at left edge of screen.
[Charles MacDonald, Lord Nightmare]

Attempt to define an I64FMT string that can be used for printf'ing 
64-bit integers. This is defined to be "I64" on MSVC and recent mingw 
compilers, and "ll" for all others. Updated all instances of 64-bit 
prints to use the new macro. [Aaron Giles]

Added spacwalk extended time setting and DIP locations. [gregf, hap]

Merged 5110intf into tms5110, and 5220intf into tms5220. [Aaron Giles]

Z80 changes: [hap]
- Fixed X/Y flags in CCF/SCF/BIT, ZEXALL is happy now
- Simplified DAA, renamed MEMPTR (3.8) to WZ (same temp register as 
   the officially named WZ in the 8080), added TODO

8085 changes: [hap]
 - fixed cycle deduction on unconditional CALL / RET, it took about 
    half too many cycles
 - added cycle tables and cleaned up source layout. This was done 
    very carefully, it should be errorfree.
 - removed HLT cycle eating (earlier, HLT after EI could theoretically 
    fail)
 - fixed parity flag on add/sub/cmp. Bug was caused by z80 overflow 
    detection accidentally left in
 - renamed temp register XX to official name WZ
 - renamed flags from Z80 style S Z Y H X V N C  to  S Z X5 H X3 P V C
    and fixed X5 / V flags where accidentally broken due to flag names 
    confusion

Fixed MSVC 64-bit compile errors. [Aaron Giles]

Added rgb[a]int_sh[l|r] operations to the rgbutils. rgbvmx needs to be 
updated. (Nobody is using them yet.) [Aaron Giles]

Added color PROM for Triple Draw Poker. [David Haywood]

Changed profiler to separate start/stop cases. [Christophe Jaillet]

taito_z DIPSW fixes [kanikani]

Added decryption key for Extreme Hunting 2. [Andreas Naive]

Naomi update:
  [R. Belmont, Deunan Knute, Alex, Mr. Mudkips, Frank Bukor]
- Use new dump for ic31/32, ROM board test passes now
- Add protection hookup for Marvel vs. Capcom 2, game is playable 
   w/sound

Added support TMS1000 family models TMS1000/1070/1100/1200/1270/1300.
Added support for configuration of output PLA to the tms0980/tms1000 
interface. [Wilbert Pol]

Implemented transparent mode access for some 6845 model sy6845.
[Roberto Lavarone]

Verified clocks + Vsyncs on Downtown, Caliber 50 and Xmen (2-4 
players). [Corrado Tomaselli]

Changed to mono both Downtown and Caliber 50: these pcbs don't have a 
stereo connector.  [Corrado Tomaselli]

Verified and added correct xtals values for cps1 boards. Added correct 
xtal and divisor for OKI6295 taken from Forgotten Worlds schematics.
[Corrado Tomaselli]

Decrypted several tables from the B-Rap Boys ROM. [David Haywood]
