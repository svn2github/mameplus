Source Changes
--------------
Fixed cdp1802 DMA emulation. [Curt Coder]

More Konami updates: [Ville Linde]
 - Hooked up vblank interrupt to Voodoo in all Voodoo-based games
 - Fixed a rom loading issue in Silent Scope
 - Added ADC1213x A/D converter emulation (machine/adc1213x)
 - Hooked up analog controls in NWK-TR games

MPU4 improvements: [James Wallace]
 - Added NMI pulsing so Deal 'Em at least starts to boot.
 - Decommissioned machine/mpu4.c, as the 6850acia code from Phil 
    does the same job, making one less thing to maintain.

Moved frontend commands and command-line handling into a central,
core-managed location clifront.c. This eliminates the need for
windows/fronthlp.c and windows/config.c and should make creating
command-line based ports much easier in the future. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed many of the remaining polygon glitches in GTI Club / Solar 
Assault / Operation Thunder Hurricane. [Ville Linde]

Added save state support to the pkscram driver. [couriersud]

Removed all the timing kludges from machine/konppc.c. GTI Club is 
kind of playable now. You can finish a lap or two, but eventually it 
will hang on network error. [Ville Linde]

Fixed the SUBTARGET=tiny build and removed some duplicate entries in 
mame.mak. [Atari Ace]

Added full discrete emulation of Space Invaders. I think people are 
going to be too used to the current samples and their relative 
levels. The new relative levels are determined by the mixing 
resistors. There are all different versions of the sound board, that 
all have slightly different sounds/components. This should be the 
proper Midway sounds. [Derrick Renaud]

Updated stvcd to be working enough that most Saturn games at least 
die for some other reason, and a few actually do useful things.
Also included a small update to the core cdrom code so you can fetch 
a sector without knowing in advance what format it is. [R. Belmont]

Added a concept of a "crosshair screen mask" internal to video.c and 
created a static call to retrieve the mask. [Nathan Woods]

Converted Roller Aces to stereo sound like the real hardware. Fixed
the clocks and NMI rates to match the PCB. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Added save state support to the Midway Y, T, X and Wolf Unit games.
[Aaron Giles]

Added preliminary 64-bit disassembly support to i386dasm.c.
[Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up internal interrupt handling in the TMS34010 core.
[Aaron Giles]

Added more accurate video timing to most of the Atari 68000-era
games. [Aaron Giles, couriersud]
