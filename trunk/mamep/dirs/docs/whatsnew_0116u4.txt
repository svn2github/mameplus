Source Changes
--------------
Changed system1 driver back to using SN7489A. [Lord Nightmare]

Fixed the road graphics, fixed the rest of the missing gfx, added 
collision detection, and added save states to the changela driver.
Also fixed the colors. [Adam Bousley]

Changed all drivers to use the mame_timer_* calls. Deprecated the
old double-based timer calls. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Changes the last few instances of rand() to mame_rand() and added a
#define to prevent it from being used again. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Made many of the static info_list*() functions in clifront.c public.
[Dave Dribin]

Fixed regression crashes in maxaflex.c, megadriv.c, monzagp.c,
tetriunk.c, and gticlub.c. [Atari Ace]

Some more TIA graphics and sound improvements: [Wilbert Pol]
 - INPT4 and INPT5 are now read when needed instead of by a timed
    function. This removes the need for the tia_init_pal function.
 - Improved handling of the HMOVE functionality
 - Added code to reduce the flickering caused by some Atari 2600 games
 - Improved the sound poly generation.
 - Improved the handling of POLY5_DIV3 sound mode.

Updated djboy driver: [Phil Stroffolino]
 - support for djboyj; same MCU, but ROM banking bits need to be XOR'd
 - fixed state handling for game over/win transitions
 - fixes for dipswitches
 - added coinage support

Fixed a few places where driver code was not properly hooked up.
Most cases were benign, but in a couple of instances, save state
support was disconnected, and in one case it fixes a potential crash.
[Atari Ace]

Fixed regression in Space Raider. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Improved frameskip behavior in the Gaelco 3d driver. [couriersud]

Fixed palette regression in warpwarp/geebee. [Atari Ace]

Added support to chdman to cope with toc files created with cue2toc.
[smf]

CPS3 updates: [David Haywood, ElSemi]
 - Corrected Clock speed, used idle skipping instead of reducing the 
    clock speed.
 - Optimized some GFX functions. It now only decodes RAM based tiles 
    when it needs to draw them, not every single time the data changes
 - Added support for CD flashing
 - Added support for alternate BIOS sets
 - Changed code to use a custom render function

Found a number of additional encrypted opcodes for gussun. [robiza]

Simplified the internal handling of BIOS sets. Instead of there being
an extra structure, the BIOS information is now embedded in the ROM
definition for each BIOS. [Atari Ace]

Fixed 2nd player inputs in Millipede. [Mike Haaland]

Fixed crash in evilngt due to missing CD image. [R. Belmont]

Fixed crash in cfarm/cclown due to out-of-bounds parameter.
[R. Belmont]

Added stricter checking in cdrom.c to prevent crashes in games when
no CD-ROM is present. [R. Belmont]

Fixed regressions in dkongjr and pestplce due to incorrect memory map
and rendering too many sprites. [couriersud]

Fixed SUBTARGET=tiny builds. [neoforma]

Hooked up P1 joystick inputs for P2 in Upright mode in a number of
black & white 8080 games. Removed cocktail settings for games where
it is not appropriate. Enabled dual player game in spclaser.
[Mike Haaland]

x64 compilation fixes: [Oliver Stoneberg]
 - some VS2005 x64 warning fixes
 - enables the x64 porting warnings in VS2005
 - adds win_create_window_ex_utf8() to get rid of some 
    tstring_from_utf8() usage
 - removed win_extract_icon_utf8()

Improved color decoding in Irem M62 games. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Synchronized MAME and AGEMAME versions of the MPU4 code. Improved
Connect4 layout. Simplified much of the code.
[James Wallace, Atari Ace]

Improved the 6532riot timer implementation. Implemented irq callback 
support. [Wilbert Pol]

Updates to the minx CPU core: [Wilbert Pol]
 - Fixed TEST (94,95,96, and 97) instructions. 
 - Fixed 2 MOV instructions (BE and BF). 
 - Fixed one AND instruction (DC).

Simplified interrupt handling in the z80gb core. [Wilbert Pol]

Hooked up lamps in Afterburner 2 driver. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed missing sound in PGM games. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed Millipede sprites in cocktail mode. [Mike Haaland]

Fixed behavior of the RC filter in ddrible and ironhors. [couriersud]

Added wrap around x for sprites in the m92 driver.
