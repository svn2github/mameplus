Source Changes
--------------
Updated clocks in Arkanoid based on measurements from a real PCB.
[Tormod Tjaberg]

Rewrote the vp906iii driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Decoded GFX properly.
 - Rewrote the memory map based on program ROMs analysis.
 - Hooked two SY6520/6280 (M6821) PIAs for I/O.
 - Hooked the SY6545 (6845) CRT controller.
 - Fixed size for screen total and visible area based on SY6545 CRTC 
    registers.
 - Added partial inputs through PIAs.
 - Added proper sound through AY8910 (mapped at $0840-$0841).
 - Proper colors through color PROM decode.
 - Added some game-protection workaround.
 - Added NVRAM support.

Removed some unnecessary NULL checks and fixed some incorrect usage
of auto_malloc. [Atari Ace]

Fixed layer drawing and polygon sorting order in Model 1 games. 
Improves wingwar significantly. [Yochizo]

Significant ARM7 update: [R. Belmont]
 * Cleaned up disassembly
 * Added support for many more Thumb instructions
 * Removed unnecessary logging
 * Unaligned reads/writes are supported

Fixed crash due to lack of CD in the Success ST-V games. [R. Belmont]

Added calls to support enumerating through options. [Nathan Woods]

Removed set_vh_global_attribute() and 
get_vh_global_attribute_changed() from the dozen or so drivers that 
used it. In the process, made an effort to clean up the video system 
for these games. The biggest improvements are route16, hyhoo, 
tutankhm and liberatr. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added a cpu core for a cpu nicknamed minx. This cpu core is used to 
emulate the cpu in the nintendo pokemon mini handheld console. 
[Wilbert Pol]

Fixed and documented clocks in Omega Race. [Tafoid]

Improved accuracy of 6502 CPU cores to implement the read/write that
happens on every cycle. Moved the "undocumented" instructions from 
the 6510 cores into the main 6502 core, since there were several 
other versions of the 6502 cores which have the same undocumented 
instructions. Removed some of the #define override magic that was 
going on to make the code easier to read and understand. Updated the 
6510 core port_read and port_write functions to include the ddr 
register in the parameters. [Wilbert Pol]

Updated the MIPS3 DRC to align the stack to sixteen-byte boundaries 
at the point of calls, as required by Mac OS X calling conventions. 
It doesn't break compatibility with Windows or Linux calling 
conventions. This fixes crashes in MIPS3 games when running on OS X 
for Intel. [Vas Crabb]

Moved the -verbose option into the core. Added new function
mame_printf_verbose() which is governed by this option. Changed all
existing verbose output to use the new functions. [Aaron Giles]

Changed cpu_boost_interleave(), cpu_spinuntil_time(), and
cpu_yielduntil_time() to take mame_time parameters instead of 
doubles. [Aaron Giles]

Changed MDRV_CPU_PERIODIC_INT() to take a frequency parameter instead
of a time. This is converted internally to a subseconds value.
[Aaron Giles]

Fixed asteroid and llander controls to be buttons not joysticks.
[Aaron Giles]

Simplified register and flags management in the TMS34010 core. 
Reviewed all flag handling and fixed a couple of minor discrepancies.
[Aaron Giles]

Hooked up actual TMS32015 on Road Riot 4WD and Steel Talons.
[Aaron Giles]

Improved access to system registers in i386 core. Added explicit
caching of segment data and flags. Fixed several minor issues.
[Aaron Giles]

Added several AY8910 variants so we can better specify the use of
compatible but slightly different chips. [Aaron Giles]



New games added or promoted from NOT_WORKING status
---------------------------------------------------
Excite League [Guru, Aaron Giles]
Super League [Guru, Aaron Giles]
Road Riot 4WD [Aaron Giles]
Gaming Draw Poker [Roberto Fresca]



New clones added
----------------
Freeze (several clones) [Aaron Giles]
Racin' Force (ver EAC) [David Haywood]
