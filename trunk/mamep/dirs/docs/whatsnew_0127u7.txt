Source Changes
--------------
Removed unneeded UI keys by removing the constants. Readded 
UI_ON_SCREEN_DISPLAY to be changed again in the "Inputs" menu. 
[stephh]

Added missing support of normal joystick for player 2 in 'gwarb'.
[stephh]

Fixed a number of regressions due to recent 68000 IRQ changes.
[Aaron Giles]

Added new functions for building device-relative tags. Changed machine
configuration builder to use these functions. Also changed the 
laserdisc player devices to use them. Updated Z80 CTC/SIO code to 
assume that the CPU provided for the clock is relative to the device 
that the CTC/SIO belong to. Updated memory code to assume that regions 
and devices referenced by the memory map are relative to the device 
the associated CPU belongs to. [Aaron Giles]

Neo-Geo cleanups (still in progress): [Johnboy]
 - Sorted OEM / Bootleg sets
 - Renamed roms on non OEM / Bootleg sets to ONE naming sheme
 - Renamed functions
 - Added some comments

System 24 cleanups: [Aaron Giles, Olivier Galibert]
 * correct memory map for both CPUs
