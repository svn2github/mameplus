Source Changes
--------------
Fixed and cleaned up the DIP switches in the dec0 driver.
[Roberto Fresca]

More improvements to the PGM video code. Also added hooks for halting
the sound CPU which allows ddp2 to boot. [David Haywood] 

Fixed incorrect lightgun names. [Derrick Renaud]

Fixed Bonze Adventure levels 2 & 9. [Bryan McPhail]

Refactored the 8530 CIA code from the Amiga into a separate module
and made it support both the 6526 and 8530 variants. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed/improved DIP switches in the megasys1, dietgo, and yunsun16
drivers. [Twisty]

Fixed some DIP switches and added controls for 2nd player in cocktail 
mode in Lost Castle in Darkmist. [Sonikos]

Fixed a number of issues in the Windows rendering code:
[Giuseppe Gorgoglione]
 * fixed blit_vectors so it used the dirty pixel array in D3D mode
 * fixed blit_vectors rotation issue for dirty pixels as well
 * changed -full_screen_brightness to -full_screen_gamma
    (which is a more correct description)
 * changed -d3dfilter to be a boolean, since the other filtering modes
    are either obsolete or not applicable to MAME
 * removed limitations on windowing position so you no longer need to
    be aligned on an 8-pixel boundary
 * cleaned up a number of unused global variables
 * improved multi-monitor support to work in GDI mode as well as in
    non-full-screen modes
 * added missing documentation for the -screen parameter

Fixed some remaining errors and inconsistencies in the content and 
usage of MAME header files by comparing declarations against actual
definitions. Removed many orphaned/duplicate declarations. Added
#includes where appropriate, and moved a few declarations to another
file when they were in the wrong location. [Atari Ace]

Removed a number of unused ROM regions. Most (but not all) of the
empty ROM region warnings are now taken care of. Also uncommented/
added missing undumped ROMs/XORs in the Namco and CPS2 games.
[Aaron Giles]
 
More Amiga cleanups: [Aaron Giles]
 * fixed dual playfield mode
 * rewrote blitter code (fixes glitches in ar_bowl and others)
 * changed Arcadia boot loading to use ROMtags instead of autoconfig
 * swapped Kickstart 1.2 in for Arcadia BIOS (fixes ar_sdwr)
