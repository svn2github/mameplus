Source Changes
--------------
Changed DIRECTINPUT & DIRECT3D handling, so they can be overridden by 
environment variables. [smf]

Readded generic calls to install memory handlers that were in long 
before 0.126u5 - these are useful on the MESS side for things like 
the PC driver. [Nathan Woods]

HD63484 improvements: [robiza]
 * fixed cpx and cpy when a ptn or a agcpy command is executed
 * fixed for PTN command: copy direction and dot color
 * first implementation of PAINT command (for now only 4bpp and 8bpp 
    supported and the pattern is not supported)

Cleaned up the discrete code and fixed discrete logging. 
[Derrick Renaud]

Fixed handling of a number of static variables to avoid multisession
issues. [Atari Ace]

Moved FD1089 decryption keys to external files. [Atari Ace]

Changed 68000 IRQ support so that the IRQ lines explicitly simulate
a standard demux chip connected to the IRQ lines. This means that the
sequence:

      cpunum_set_input_line(5, ASSERT_LINE);
      cpunum_set_input_line(3, ASSERT_LINE);
      cpunum_set_input_line(3, CLEAR_LINE);

now works as expected. This required fixes to several Atari and other
drivers. [Olivier Galibert]

Input port cleanup pass over drivers from N-V, leveraging
AM_READ_PORT, converting to full 32-bit inputs where suitable, using
CUSTOM_PORTs for EEPROM bits, etc. [Fabio Priuli]

Additional input port cleanups in the cps1, deco, pgm, psikyo, nbmj,
and jaleco drivers. [Fabio Priuli]

snk.c rewrite: [Nicola Salmoria]
 - fixed sprite-sprite priorities
 - TNK3, Athena, Fighting Golf, Country Club
    - converted to tilemaps
    - removed hacks
    - proper memory maps
    - screen flip / cocktail mode support
    - DIP locations
    - better implementation of sound CPU communication
    - hooked sound CPU interrupts to YM chips
    - fitegolf hax 1xYM3812, not 2xYM3526
 - Ikari Warriors, Victory Road
    - removed ROM patches
    - simulated "hard flags" behaviour
    - proper memory maps
    - fixed ikarijp color test
    - renamed dogosokj to dogosokb and loaded the correct palette PROMs
    - inputs, dip locations, etc.
    - removed NO_COCKTAIL flag since these games don't have a flip 
       screen dip switch
 - Guerrilla War, Psycho Soldier, Chopper I, TouchDown Fever / 
   Fighting Soccer
    - tilemaps
    - proper memory map
    - input, dip locations, etc.
 - Bermuda Triangle / World Wars
    - removed ROM patches
    - simulated "turbo front" check
    - renamed bermudao->bermudaj
    - clarified the relationship between the four sets
    - made World Wars a main set instead of a clone of Bermuda Triangle
    - tliemaps, proper memory maps, inputs, etc.
 - ASO 
    - moved from hal21.c to snk.c
    - removed hacks, fixed bg color
 - Gladiator
    - moved from sgladiat.c to snk.c
    - fixed shadows, visible area, tilemaps, inputs, etc.
 - Jumping Cross
    - moved from jcross.c to snk.c
    - fixed fg layer and visible area
    - the game seems to be ok now? is there still something wrong?

Added 8303 ROM to the games using it and updated MCU simulation to 
match the new findings. [Nicola Salmoria]

Removed duplicate buttons in sf2hack. Promoted sf2m2 clone to
working. [robiza]

Added helper function devtag_get_device(machine, type, tag) to 
retrieve the device_config for (type, tag). [couriersud]

Hooked up sound CPU comms in Power Instinct 2. This enables 
synchronized dancing for the background characters. [ShimaPong]

Fixed bug when writing AVI files with more than one RIFF chunk.
Added missing chdman error messages when extracting to an AVI file.
[Aaron Giles]

Derived CPS2/CPS3 video timing based on measurements. These are 
educated guesses. The logic behind the derivations is shown in the 
source. [Aaron Giles]

Game-A-Tron gambling hardware updates: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Added sound support to "Poker 4-1" and "Pull Tabs".
 - Figured out the output ports. Documented each bit accessed.
 - Added button lamps support. Created layouts for both games.
 - Switched the 8255 port C to be used as output port.
 - Adjusted the coin pulse timing.
 - Updated technical notes.
 - Splitted the driver to driver + video.
 - Final clean-up.

Fixed problem that would cause the "Return To Prior Menu" menu item to 
not stick if one is calling ui_menu_reset() with 
UI_MENU_RESET_REMEMBER_POSITION, and that menu item is selected.
[Nathan Woods]

Added PR-8210 support to the ldplayer. Fixed step forward command on 
the PR-8210. [Aaron Giles]

Changed Journey and Domino Man to 4-way joysticks. [John Rieman]

Added Discrete Sound for Starship 1. Still need to properly emulate 
the MC3340. [Derrick Renaud]

Changed some decryptions in igs_blit.c to use program roms loaded 
byteswapped. Decrypted Mahjong Man Guan Cai Shen, Mahjong Long 
Hu Zheng Ba 2, Mahjong Shuang Long Qiang Zhu 2, and Mahjong Super 
Da Man Guan 2. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added save state for discrete node->output to ensure that input nodes
save states. [couriersud]

Added a new generic latch device. Generic emulation of 74LS174/175, 
74LS259 and other latches. Apart from providing synched latch 
operation, these latches can be configured to read their input 
bitwise from other devices as well and individual bits can be 
connected to discrete nodes. Please see audio/dkong.c for examples.
[couriersud]

dkong & friends: Use new latch device [couriersud]
 * adds new latch device where appropriate
 * increased accuracy since now all main/sound cpu communications 
    are properly latched
 * removed quite some code as a consequence
 * minor cosmetic edits

Updated adp memory map. [robiza]

m4510 core fixes: [robiza]
 - banking in read and write operations
 - jsr and jsrx instruction
 - fixed TSY instruction

Optimized ycc_to_rgb conversion code. [couriersud]

Added readme for The Simpsons. [Guru]

zn.c improvements: [smf]
 - Improved dip switch emulation, ram hacks to get games booting are 
    no longer required.
 - Added gun emulation for judge dredd.
 - Fixed judge dredd ide emulation when building with visual studio.
 - Mapped primal rage 2 inputs
 - Mapped player 3 & 4 inputs for 1 on 1 government, these are now 
    the default with the 6 button inputs only mapped for games that 
    need them.
 - Converted AT28C16 to a device.
 - Added preliminary support for devices to load/save nvram.

Added some initial logic to boot and run the PR-8210 ROM (i8049)
in ldplayer.c. Currently this is disabled behind a compile-time
switch. Once this is working, the plan is to incorporate this into
the existing PR-8210 emulation, but we're not there yet. [Aaron Giles]

Changed Trivia Quest clocks based on some really old information.
[Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added new function tilemap_set_pen_data_offset(). While this isn't 
'free' as tilemap_set_palette_offset() is (when the offset changes, 
the pixmap cache needs to be invalidated), it helps removing some 
redundant code from drivers. Updated snk.c and snk68.c to take 
advantage of the new function. [Nicola Salmoria]

Significant cleanup/rewrite of the MCS-48 CPU core:
 * renamed from i8039 to mcs48
 * changed to use data address space for internal RAM
 * added internal memory maps for variants with internal RAM/ROM
 * added a number of variants from documentation
 * removed redundant and unused definitions from header file
 * renamed constants and functions to be MCS48* prefixed
 * re-verified all opcode behaviors and timing
 * changed illegal opcodes to count 1 cycle to avoid infinite loops
 * changed EA behavior so that it is a push from the driver instead of a pull on each opcode fetch 
    (this may change further in the future). 
 * reimplemented IRQ generation and timer behavior according to documentation
 * updated all drivers accordingly
 * fixed several uses of PULSE_LINE, which no longer works

SH4, Naomi, and Hikaru updates [Samuele Zannoli]
 - Fixed SH-4 core to support multiple SH-4s
 - Fixed LDCSR instruction
 - Fixed SH-4 I/O ports
 - Skeleton Hikaru driver with memory maps and both SH-4s
 - Fixed JVS/Maple translation so Naomi 2 BIOS runs

Fixed Dip Switches and Inputs for 'jcross' and 'sgladiat'. [stephh]

Changed slider controls into a menu. For now, removed the old direct 
access mechanism; instead, you must access the sliders via the main 
menu. While in the menu, you can use the ~ key to turn off the menu 
display and leave only the bar display, in order to see more of the 
screen. [Aaron Giles]

Namco NB 1/2 work: [Olivier Galibert]
 - Shares the memory with the c75.
 - Renames the c75 region to c7x from user4.
 - Implements the c75 reset/halt control.
 - Implements the irqs more correctly.

Small optimization to memory handling for 68000 core. 
[Christophe Jaillet]

Fixed input port confusion in the 8080bw driver. Connected AVGDVG
status bits via PORT_CUSTOM. [Fabio Priuli]

Updated stepper motor code to use a MAME-style config interface, 
rather than a load of setting functions. Changed optic functions to 
use clearly defined start and end points. Added standard layout for 
Starpoint units used in many machines. Updated all affected drivers.
[James Wallace]

Removed useless backslashes lurking throughout the code. [Atari Ace]

Improvements to magic10.c driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Added Magic's 10 version 16.15
 - Remapped all inputs to match other poker games.
 - Added a missing input to Magic's 10 games.
