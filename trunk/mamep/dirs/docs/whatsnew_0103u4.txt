Source Changes

Intel i386/i486/Pentium update: [Nathan Woods]
 - Fixed A20 mask implementation
 - Added A20 mask to debugger translate callback
 - Implemented Pentium opcode CMPXCHG8B
 - Fixed XADD, and added support for the 8 and 16 bit variants

Fixed Top Shooter sprites. Game still not playable. [Tomasz Slanina]

Changed debug view property code to pass property values as unions rather 
than void pointers, in order to appease compilers that whine about strict 
aliasing. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed resource allocation issue with bitmaps in the Windows code and
MESS. [Nathan Woods]

Removed a number of unnecessary video_stop and machine_stop routines.
[Atari Ace]

Fixed inputs on Ninja Spirit and the Sega System 16b driver to match the
JAMMA button ordering. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Fixes to the Hyperstone core: [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
 - Removed nested delays
 - Don't allow software opcodes to be executed in a delay slot

Added/changed the following discrete modules: [Derrick Renaud]
 - DISCRETE_WAVELOG - easy way to log discrete nodes as a .wav file to 
    compare against scope waveforms.
 - DISCRETE_OUTPUT - added a final gain parameter to get it to 16 bit 
    wav level.  (The old VOL setting was disabled after the last sound 
    re-write.)

Fixed graphics banking in 8751-based Altered Beast sets. [David Haywood]

Fixed some bad gfx in kdynastg when levels start. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

OKIM6295, and YMZ280B sound cores to output at their native sample rates, 
allowing the core sound system to perform over/re-sampling to the output 
rate. [Aaron Giles]
