WARNING: Starting with this version, the MAME windows run on a
separate thread. There may be issues relating to this, especially
when running unthrottled. If you see any crashes or odd behavior
under normal operation, be sure to report it to

Source Changes
--------------
Cleaned up decocass driver: [Juergen Buchmueller]
 - All hardcoded tables are gone now
 - cexplore.pro 32 byte PROM reverse engineered

Fixed windows.mak to support 64-bit builds. [Malice]

Fixed bug where the gamename was reallocated out from under us by
the new config system. [Nathan Woods]

Added the ability to specify a callback when a given option is 
parsed.  This is used on the MESS side to add system-specific
command line options. [Nathan Woods]

More generic 6840 improvements. [El Condor]

Some improvements to the Pasha Pasha 2 driver. [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Added experimental OSD locks: [Aaron Giles]
 - osd_lock_alloc() allocates a lock
 - osd_lock_acquire() acquires a lock, blocking until success
 - osd_lock_try() tries to acquire a lock and returns whether or
    not it succeeded
 - osd_lock_release() releases a lock
 - osd_lock_free() frees memory used by a lock
If the OSD layer is not using multiple threads, these can just be
stubbed out (return TRUE for osd_lock_acquire and fake the rest).

Fixed ESC key not cancelling out of initial UI screens. [Aaron Giles]

More rendering changes/fixes: [Aaron Giles]
 - Added new render_view_item_get_state() function to return the
    state of a given item
 - Changed render_target_get_primitives to return a new structure
    render_primitive_list, which contains the list of primitives
    along with an osd_lock which must be held while the list is
    being traversed
 - Added "Rotate View" option to the video menu for dynamic in-game
    rotation
 - Moved window creation and management to a separate thread; this
    means all software rendering and all Direct3D calls are done on
    a separate thread from the main game, and will take advantage of
    multiple CPUs/dual cores
 - Changed throttling behavior to skip rendering if we are already
    pending; this makes for a better "fast forward" effect
 - Added -prescale option to pre-scale the game bitmaps before
    rendering to the screen; this helps get rid of the "fuzzy" look
    when running with -filter enabled, at the expense of some speed.
    Note that only integral values are currently supported (no "auto")
