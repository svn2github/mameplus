Source Changes
--------------
Fixed input port read at init time in grchamp.c. [Curt Coder]

Fixed input port read validation. The previous check was way too 
aggressive, and prevented CUSTOM_INPUT handlers from reading other 
ports. This one sets an "all clear" flag as soon as the configuration 
data is loaded. [Aaron Giles]

GX era haradware: update video parameters to use actual values written 
to the CCU. [Yasuhiro Ogawa]

MultiPCM/315-5560 rewrite. All features are now supported including 
PLFO and ALFO. [ElSemi]

Fixed read from input port during VIDEO_START in namcofl.c.
[couriersud]

Cleaned up z80dma interface [couriersud]
 * removed compatibility to old z80dma driver
 * now uses std. callbacks (READ8_HANDLER, WRITE8_HANDLER)
 * updated mario and dkong3 accordingly

Implemented 8257 dma controller as proper device [couriersud]
 * rewrote 8257dma.[ch]
 * updated dkong.c accordingly

dkong.c: Merge driver init code for drakton and strtheat [couriersud]
 * made decryption for drakton and strtheat more compact
 * moved decryption and driver init code into dkong.c
 * deleted drakton.c and strtheat.c

Added emulation of ST-0026 NiLe (sound). Added audio to Super 
Real Mahjong P6. [Tomasz Slanina, R. Belmont]

i8x41 improvements: [Wilbert Pol]

 - Added support for re-enabling interrupts inside
    an interrupt handler.
 - Fixed cycle count for DJNZ instruction.

Converted voodoo into a proper device. Updated drivers accordingly.
[Aaron Giles]

Cal Omega driver updates: [Roberto Fresca]

 - Added preliminary serial/UART support to systems 903/904.
 - Hooked the missing DIP Switches bank to the ACIA 6850 for systems 
    903/904. It allow to choose the proper transfer rate for UART.
 - Fixed graphics ROM loads for different Hotline versions.
 - Added support to Game 8.0 (Arcade Black Jack).

Save state support: [Aaron Giles]
 * added save state support to the MIPS3 recompiler
 * added save state support to CAGE audio system
 * added save state support to the voodoo emulator
 * added save state support to the smc91c9x emulator
 * added save state support to the kinst, seattle, and vegas drivers
 * fixed core video handling of save states with dynamic screen resolutions
 * added save state support to the SHARC CPU core
 * added save state support to the PowerPC recompiler
 * added save state support to the virtual TLB system
 * added save state support to the RF5C400 sound core
 * added save state support to konppc module
 * added save state support to K056800 host controller
 * added save state support to the Konami hornet driver

SMC91C9x: [Aaron Giles]
 * converted to proper device
 * updated seattle and vegas drivers to allocate devices
 * added separate 91C96 device for eventual 2049 use
 * cleaned up code

Added machine parameter to memory_region() and memory_region_length()
functions. Cleaned up usage of these throughout the code to cache
pointers rather than calling these functions repeatedly during loops.
[Atari Ace]

Fixed poor default CLUT handling in the voodoo driver. [Aaron Giles]

Added additional Naomi BIOSes. [Brian Troha, Guru]

DRC fixes: [Aaron Giles]
 * Fixed WRITEM opcode on 64-bit to call through memory instead of 
    directly. Solves assertions with gcc 4.3 and 64-bit linux.
 * Fixed DCMP opcode on the 32-bit back-end
 * Fixed LZCNT opcode in x86 and x64 back-ends
 * Added support for flags in LZCNT and BSWAP opcodes on x86 and x64 
    back-ends

Changed debugger so it does not stop while we are waiting for a 
pending event to occur. This eliminates some confusion during reset 
and state loading. [Aaron Giles]

Explicitly disabled overlays for non-native snapshots (native 
snapshots already had them disabled). [Aaron Giles]

Added more complete readmes for Konami PowerPC games. [Guru]

Cleaned up system register access in Konami PowerPC games. Connected
EEPROM in hornet driver (doesn't seem to affect much). Altered network
IRQ timing to fix several problems. Most games are back to their
previous "working" states. [Aaron Giles]

Changed DRC frontend to pass a pointer to the previous instruction
when describing. Updated PowerPC frontend to approximately take into
account branch and CR logic folding in timing computations. 
[Aaron Giles]

Updated cheat system: [Shimapong]
 - Merged 3 different search menu functions to search_main_menu()
 - Added new cheat options, "Vertical/Horizontal Key Repeat Speed"
     NOTE : delete all cheat options in the database before start
            or reload default options (Shift + Reload key)
            in cheat general menu
 - Changed assignment of Entry for Activation Key and Pre-enable
   command code. Now there are check the tag in comment field
   instead of index number. But it's only for new format command
   and old is as before
 - Added tag output in save_activation_key() and save_pre_enable()
 - Cleaned up save_cheat_options() to output description
 - Changed memory read function in watchpoints
   No longer "Debugger" watchpoint mis-hit "Cheat" watchpoint
 - Fixed several reported/found bugs
 - Renamed funcitons/enum based on coding guidlines
   All functions are completed in this update

Removed DEBUGGER flag from makefile and ENABLE_DEBUGGER macro from 
the source code. All MAME builds now include the debugger, and it is 
enabled/disabled exclusively by the runtime command-line/ini settings. 
This is a minor speed hit for now, but will be further optimized going 
forward. [Aaron Giles]

Changed the 'd' suffix in the makefile to apply to DEBUG builds 
(versus DEBUGGER builds as it did before). [Aaron Giles]

Changed machine->debug_mode to machine->debug_flags. These flags now 
indicate several things, such as whether debugging is enabled, whether 
CPU cores should call the debugger on each instruction, and whether 
there are live watchpoints on each address space. Redesigned a 
significant portion of debugcpu.c around the concept of maintaining 
these flags globally and a similar, more complete set of flags 
internally for each CPU. All previous functionality should work as 
designed but should be more robust and faster to work with.
[Aaron Giles]

Added new debugger hooks for starting/stopping CPU execution. This 
allows the debugger to decide whether or not a given CPU needs to call 
the debugger on each instruction during the coming timeslice. Also
added new debugger hook for reporting exceptions. Proper exception 
breakpoints are not yet implemented. [Aaron Giles]

Added 360degree wheel (dial) input to GTMR, which is available when 
the Controller dip is set to 'Wheel', and Controls dip is set to 
'1P Side'. Note when Controls dip is set to 'Both Sides', 270degree 
wheel (paddle) input is used. [Minwah]

Verified clocks and adjusted sound volumes in Fairyland Story.
[Corrado Tomaselli]

More conversion to input_port_read: [Fabio Priuli]
 * updated the whole mid*unit family of drivers + seattle & zeus 
    which shared some input code.
 * updated most namco systems + a couple of old drivers sharing the 
    input handling, minus namcos22
 * updated most of the M->Q drivers + finally removed indexed reads 
    from megadriv.c (without breaking ssf2ghw)
 * removed indexed read from drivers starting with r (and slightly 
    simplify inputs in royalmah.c)
 * unified nichibustu mahjong input ports (using common ports in 
    nbmj9195.c as well as in the other drivers), removed indexed read 
    and exploited tags to reduce complexity in a couple of handlers

Fixed missing sha1 values in ampoker2.c, atarigx2.c, cabal.c, and 
ksys573.c. [John Gilbert]

Fixed a few build problems with the cpu/sound cores M65CE02, 
ALPHA8201, TMC0285, TMS5200 and corrected the dependencies for
the mips core. [Atari Ace]

Finish the work on ddragon3: [Sonikos]
 - Mapped the correct dip "SW1-8" before was incorrect
 - Added "FBI Logo" dips in ctribe
 - Fixed the dips condition's implementation to avoid the mame crash 
    in ctribe
 - Change the name of (Italian bootleg) in a better (bootleg Set 2)

Set OKI 6295 pin 7 to high in gotcha driver. [Sonikos]

Fixed make MSVC_BUILD=1 -j2 and corrected an oversight in the 
cross-build support. [Atari Ace]

Cleaned up most of the Machine stuff in src/emu/machine. There is
a bit left to clean up, but it's mostly stuck at some interfaces now.
[Oliver Stoeneberg]
