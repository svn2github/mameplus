Source Changes
--------------
Discrete sound for Checkmate: [Derrick Renaud]
 * new DISCRETE_ADJUSTMENT_TAG module that uses tags instead of port 
   numbers. Updated all games to use it, because it is now the 
   preferred method.
 * added PORT_CROSSHAIRs to triplhnt.

Minor Konami 573 system update: [smf]
 * marks two games as working which were incorrectly tagged
 * adds the correct hashes for 845jab02
 * added NO_DUMP's for all the flash roms

Fixed a number of issues related to the new streaming engine and
sound code: [Aaron Giles]
 * fixed crash when restoring from a save state
 * fixed crash when running with -nosound
 * fixed loud looping when halted in the debugger
 * fixed crash when changing sample rates (YM2203 mainly)
 * fixed crash in k054539 sound core

Added SN76477 noise RNG polynomial. [Zsolt Vasvari, Derrick Renaud, 
Jarek Burczynski]

Midway 8080 driver updates: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 * fixed bug where mw8080bw games would freeze after state load.
 * corrected DIP SW order in M-4
 * converted Dog Patch to PORT_POSITIONAL

RF5C400 sound core improvements: [hoot development team]
 * implemented volume envelopes
 * ccorrected the channel volume calculation
 * documented registers for reverb, chorus, and per-channel digital 
    filter (actual effects are not implemented yet)

Fixeed most Dip Switches and Inputs in the galspnbl driver.
[stephh, Justin Szczap]

Updated a number of drivers to use the new PORT_DIPUNUSED macros.
[stephh]

Improvements to the memory pool routines: [Nathan Woods]
 - added a pool_clear() call, to clear out a memory pool without 
    freeing the pool itself
 - added support for pool_realloc() with a size of zero, which 
    effectively frees a pointer within a pool
 - added testing code to validate pool behavior

Added support for more flexible word wrapping with CJK characters.
Also added wrapping on hyphens. [MAME Plus! team, Aaron Giles]

Added T5182 support, which gives sound to darkmist, mustache and 
panicr. Also changed the YM2151 to prevent timer problems, and added
the missing flip X in Mustache Boy. [Nicola Salmora, Lord Nightmare,
Ernesto Corvi]

More input fixes and improvements: [Derrick Renaud]
 * fixed some obscure masking, shifting, overflow, and signed 
    problems in the input system. Most noticeably this fixes the 
    analog controls in sfootbal and stops the pedal in redlin2p from 
    rotating through gas/no gas as the pedal is pressed.
 * analog ports no longer save and load their default value from the 
    config file. It should only ever use the value specified in the 
    driver, and storing it can cause problems the more the game is 
    restarted and the value starts to change.
 * added a bunch of validity tests to the analog ports. Some are 
    commented out until the problems they uncovered are fixed.
 * analog ports now defalt to a PORT_MINMAX of (0,mask). This means 
    you no longer have to specify PORT_MINMAX if you are not using 
    any limits. Removed a bunch of no longer needed PORT_MINMAX 
    entries.

Bitmaps are now cleared to 0 by default. This fixes a number of random
crashes in games. [Aaron Giles]

Modified the raster position calculations to round to the nearest
pixel which produces more consistent results. [Aaron Giles]

Changed most sound cores to generate audio at their internal clock
rates (or some multiple/divisor of them) rather than at the user
specified output rate. This completes the second step of decoupling
audio emulation from the user's sample rate choice. [Aaron Giles]

Removed a big pile of goofiness from the DMA-driven DAC driver now
that it is no longer necessary. [Aaron Giles]

Removed custom sound code from cchasm and replaced it with a simple
DAC implementation. [Aaron Giles]

Cleaned up attckufo driver, making it perform like a 1MHz 6502 game
once again. [Aaron Giles]



New games marked as GAME_NOT_WORKING
