Source Changes
--------------
SCSI CD emulation improvements: [Ville Linde]
 - Added Play Audio (12) command
 - Fixed track number and added MSF support to Read Sub-Channel 
    command

Added workaround for broken MediaGX driver. [Ville Linde]

Reworked the SNES raster timing to use MDRV_SCREEN_RAW_PARAMS() and 
friends. All but one of the "electronics tests" in the SNES 
diagnostics cart now pass with flying colors. [R. Belmont]

Fixed Super Breakout layout. [Mr. Do]

CPS2 updates: [David Haywood]
 - Added table for Jyangoku (from Guru). Note that GFX/Sound roms 
    aren't dumped on this one.
 - Removed old 'handcrafted' xors for games which we have CHDs for 
    and replaced them with xors generated from MAME using the CHD.  
    This means anyone with the CHD can easily generate the xors 
    (using the code I've left in there) if they need to be able to 
    run the games with a shorter startup time.
 - Disabled the loading of the xors by default for all sets with a 
    CHD. Now only the CHD is loaded, unless the #define is changed 
    at the top in which case only the xors generated from the CHD 
    are loaded.

Added support for more than 4 mouse buttons on versions of Windows 
that support it. Win98/Me with DX7+ or XP. It defaults to regular 4 
buttons if not supported. [Derrick Renaud]

Fixed the crosshairs in the PlayChoice-10 gun games that got 
buggered in the conversion to multi-monitor support. [Derrick Renaud]

Rewrote the Dragon's Lair driver from the schematics. Added new
module machine/laserdsc.c which has laserdisc emulation for the
PR-7280 and LD-V1000 laserdisc players. Full emulation of the
laserdisc is pending support for CHD audio/video and high quality 
rips, but you can operate the game and see the frame numbers that
would be displayed. Added built-in layout to display the scores, 
lives, and credit information. [Aaron Giles]

Added some hacks to windows.mak to allow limping compilation under
Windows Vista. To make these work set an environment variable called
VISTA_MINGW_ROOT equal to the base of your mingw directory, and add
%VISTA_MINGW_ROOT%\libexec\gcc\mingw32\3.4.2 to your PATH environment.
There are still a few issues, but this will let you build with MSVC,
and will compile most of the code with gcc (minus a couple of Windows
OSD files). Hopefully the mingw folks will resolve these issues.
