Added support for >4GB CHD files to chdman for non-Windows systems.
[Lawrence Gold]

Fixed leapyear calculation. [William Krick]

Converted Super Burger Time, Vapor Trail, and Crude Buster to use the 
deco tilemap functions. [David Haywood]

Rewrote Neo-Geo video system, removing distinction between raster and
non-raster games and cleaning up the code significantly. [David Haywood]

Improved DIP switches for clowns, clowns1, and bowler. [Bob Seidel]

Added CPUINFO_PTR_DEBUG_SETUP_COMMANDS: a callback that is invoked to 
tell CPU cores to set up commands specific to a CPU core. [Nathan Woods]

Added SegBase() and SegLimit() functions to the i386 core debugger.
[Nathan Woods]

Improved sound balance in Night Slashers. [MAME Italia]

Improvements to the Deco MLC games (added sprite buffering, fixed tile

fix). The only thing left for this driver is really raster support for 
the pitch in Stadium Hero. [Bryan McPhail]

Major Namco System 22 update: [Phil Stroffolino]
 * Hooked up the real master DSP BIOS.  Many games are now working or
    displaying graphics that were having problems before; removed many
    hacks as a result.
 * Hooked up the runtime-configurable interrupt handlers, removing more
    game-specific hacks.
 * Some improvements and additional documentation of video hardware.
 * Emulated Alpine Surfer protection and fixed bogus loading of Point
    ROMs, though the game still has problems.

Fixed in the old debugger the display of opcodes for word-addressed CPUs 
like the TMS32010, which was completely broken before. [Alex Jackson]

Separated debugger break key from OSD display. They can now be programmed
differently. Also fixed behavior in the new debugger when using the break so
that text doesn't get entered onto the command line. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed the handling of address masking and display within the debugger.
[Aaron Giles, Nathan Woods]

Fixed order of operations in the expression engine if functions were used.
