----------------------
00817 [RansAckeR]



Source Changes
--------------
MC6845 updates: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 * now signalling both 0->1 and 1->0 transitions of synching pins
 * added mc6845_assert_light_pen_input; uses a timer for latching 
    the light pen address
 * added reset device function
 * implemented VSYNC height computation difference between the 
    Motorola and the Rockwell devices
 * since the Commodore 40xx computers program an HSYNC width that 
    extends past the end of the scanline, I am clamping it in lack 
    of anything better to do
 * added support for the Commodore 6545-1 device type
 * added support for the status register
 * better variable names
 * more asserts
 
Updated the "Input (This Game)" menu to support conditional inputs.
[stephh]

Converted Amiga based games to partial updating and proper scanline 
based timers. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Beginning of the clean-up of Space Guerilla - fixed rotation, some 
other stuff. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Removed use of tmpbitmap from some drivers. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Replaced mame_bitmap with direct use of bitmap_t. Removed mame_bitmap
typedef. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fixed taitoic regression that caused crashes in several games.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Changed the way VBLANK_INTs are handled:
 - Defined a new MDRV_CPU_VBLANK_INT_HACK() (in deprecat.h) which is 
    a copy of the current MDRV_CPU_VBLANK_INT()
 - Found all the places where VBLANK_INT is used with something other 
    than 1 interrupt per frame and changed it to the new macro
 - Removed the "# per frame" parameter from MDRV_SCREEN_VBLANK_INT() 
    and added a screen tag in its place; updated all callers 
    appropriately.
 - Added some validation of the interrupt setup to validate.c 

Fixed SH4 refresh ticks value of 0, makes awbios not blow up the 
timer system. [R. Belmont]

Updated dkong driver to use two discrete structs which were previously
not being used: [couriersud]
 * dkong walk using a jump struct 
 * radarscp using a dkong 555 struct

MACHINE_DRIVER_EXTERN now requires a semicolon. Removed a number of 
extra semicolons. [couriersud]

In memory.c: removed some code never to be executed: [couriersud]
 * removed "return 0" from READ* macros since it is unreachable
 * removed comparisons of type FPTR < 0 and FPTR >= 0

Identified code not used and marked with "#ifdef UNUSED_FUNCTION".
[couriersud]

Naomi: Use defines instead of magic numbers for IRQ sources, add 
VBL-out. [R. Belmont]

Improved (not perfect) ACIA slot monitoring. [kingshriek]

Changed parent/clone relationship to separate SSI Poker sets from 
Jackpot Joker Poker. [Roberto Fresca]

Removed a couple of unused items from the cpuexec_data structure.
Added validity check that screenless drivers cannot have a VBLANK
interrupt. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added macros to define device functions. Updated existing devices
to use the macros. [Aaron Giles]

Added the concept of device classes. Devices specify their class
in their get_info function. Classes can be used to walk through
devices at a more general level than their type. Functions have
been added to iterate through devices by class just as you can
by type. [Aaron Giles]

Removed some unused fields from device_config. [Aaron Giles]

Moved all video timing logic from cpuexec.c to video.c. Added a 
video_screen_register_vbl_cb() function for registering VBLANK 
callbanks. Changed inptport.c and debugcpu.c to make use the VBLANK 
callbacks. Added video_screen_get_time_until_vblank_start(). I did 
some fairly extensive testing, but this is a very signficant internal 
change, so some things may have broke. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Removed use of cpu_scalebyfcount() from CVS driver. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Changed a number of global functions to being static. [couriersud]

Rewrote some potentially compiler specific code: [couriersud]
 * added ATTR_FORCE_INLINE to osdcomm.h
 * added ATTR_NONNULL
 * moved U64 S64 fram mamecore.h to osdcomm.h
 * define SETJMP_GNUC_PROTECT() in osdcomm.h for use in ppc602, ppc603

Removed cpu_getcurrentframe() and replaced it with 
video_screen_get_frame_number(int scrnum). Updated all callers.
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Moved watchdog processing logic into its own module. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Replaced sprite multiplexing hack in tp84.c with 
video_screen_update_now() on sprite RAM write. General driver 
clean-up. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Gyruss: Tilemap conversion, sprite multiplexing done properly, driver 
clean-up. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Changed z80dma to new device interface, updated mario.c and dkong.c 
to use new interface. Illustrates how to keep existing memory 
read/write handlers. This is slower than caching the device interface, 
but does not have an impact on devices accessed at a low frequency 
like in this case. [couriersud]

Added video_screen_get_time_until_vblank_end() and
video_screen_get_time_until_update(). [Aaron Giles]

Fixed CCPU and QB3 to no longer rely on cpu_scalebyfcount(). Fixed 
busted timing in the CCPU core. Changed watchdog to count internally 
rather than using external watchdog support. Altered CCPU to accept 
interrupt signals from the driver. Updated clocks in the cinemat 
driver to be derived from the clock crystal. [Aaron Giles]

Normalized function pointer typedefs: they are now all
suffixed with _func. Did this throughout the core and
drivers I was familiar with. [Aaron Giles]

Added PORT_CHANGED macro which calls a callback if the given port 
changes. Usage is very similar to PORT_CUSTOM. See the Astro Invader 
driver for an example. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Removed input_port_set_changed_callback and converted all users to 
PORT_CHANGED. The only difference between the old callback and the 
ones supplied by PORT_CHANGED is that values passed by PORT_CHANGED 
are normalized to start at bit 0, just like PORT_CUSTOM. 
[Zsolt Vasvari]

Added running_machine* to the CUSTOM_INPUT callback - updated drivers 
to use it. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Updated brkthru.c, btime.c, exerion.c, fcombat.c, astrof.c, 
cheekyms.c, cinemat.c to use PORT_CHANGED. Combined memory maps where 
applicable. Converted cheekyms.c to use tilemaps. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Merged memory maps for drivers X->Z. [Andrew Gardner]

Exidy440: modernized input port handling with CUSTOM_INPUT and 
INPUT_CHANGED. Cleaned-up special case handling. Created better
separation between driver and video code. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Verified clocks and oki pin7 for Peek-a-boo. [Mike Ellery]

Untangled the Fire Truck driver. Many uses of PORT_CUSTOM and 
PORT_CHANGED, including another good use case for the gear shift 
logic. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Updated ladybug.c, lasso.c, m10.c, madalien.c, maxaflex.c to use
PORT_CHANGED for coinage. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added running_machine * parameter to the front of all read/write 
handlers. Updated all call-through handlers appropriately. Renamed 
read8_handler to read8_machine_func, replicating this pattern 
throughout. [Aaron Giles]

Defined new set of memory handler functions which are similar but 
which pass a const device_config * in place of the running_machine *. 
These are called read8_device_func, etc. Added macros 
READ8_DEVICE_HANDLER() for specifying functions of this type.
[Aaron Giles]

Added running_machine * to the device_config, live while the device
is live, and NULL otherwise, just like the token. [Aaron Giles]

Meadows driver updates: [Zsolt Vasvari]
 - Merged memory maps
 - Uses PORT_CHANGED for coins
 - Renamed 'Inferno (S2650) to 'Inferno (Meadows)'
 - Renamed 'Bowling 3D' to '3-D Bowling'
 - Added NO_DUMP entries for Gypsy Juggler's ball graphics and added GAME_IMPERFECT_GRAPHICS flag

Fixed sprite colors in Exerion. [Zsolt Vasvari]

Added new macros AM_DEVREAD, AM_DEVWRITE, and AM_DEVREADWRITE,
which specify device read/write handlers in address maps, along
with the type/tag of the device they reference. [Aaron Giles]

Converted MC6845 read/write handlers to READ/WRITE8_DEVICE_HANDLERs.
Updated all MC6845-using drivers to use the new macros and call
the updated functions. Removed the many little helper functions
that used to do this work. [Aaron Giles]

Added validity checks to ensure that the devices referenced
actually exist. [Aaron Giles]

Fixed display of screen information so that it shows live information,
not just the original configurations. [SailorSat]

Improved DIP switch definitions, added DIP locations, and simplified
input ports in atarisy2.c, atetris.c, avalnche.c, bagman.c, 
balsente.c, lasso.c, seta.c. [RasnAckeR]

Added DIPs and locations to onetwo.c. [Sonikos]

Corrected some glitches and fixed bank reading in Deal'Em.
[James Wallace]

Changed/verified clocks on the following pcbs: 1943, Arkanoid, Action 
Holliwood GalsPanic, Ben Bero Beh, 1000 Miglia, Pit and Run, 
Prehistoric Isle, Rastan, Hotmind, Hardtimes, Stagger1 and 
Tiger Road. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Changed/verified Oki pin 7 on the following pcbs: 1000 miglia, 
Galspanic, Action Holliwood, Hotmind, HardTimes, World Rally, 
Stagger1. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Added the new display types to the listxml DTD. [Oliver Stoneberg]

Internal address map constructor changes: [couriersud]
 * pass running_machine parameter to construct_map_##_name
 * change "Machine->" to "machine->" in AM_BASE_MEMBER, AM_SIZE_MEMBER
 * pass Machine in construct_address_map

Mysterious Stones gets the "full treatment". [Zsolt Vasvari]

Fix 8085 RST75 not working with PULSE_LINE. According to datasheet, 
RST7.5 is latched on rising edge, while the other maskable interrupts 
are sampled. [Nicola Salmoria]

Removed AM_SPACE and matchmask support. Updated relevant drivers
to use AM_MIRROR() and AM_MASK() to achieve the same thing. 
[Aaron Giles]
