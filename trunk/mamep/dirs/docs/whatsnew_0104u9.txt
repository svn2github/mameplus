Source Changes
--------------
Added decryption of kof2003 p3 ROM. [iq_132]

Changed comment prefix in debugger command scripts from '#' to '//'.
[Nathan Woods]

Fixed makefile to allow command-line override of MAMEOS and TARGET
variables. [smf, Aaron Giles]

Fixed gsword, which was broken in an earlier update. [Tatsuyuki Satoh]

Cleaned up error logging so that it is callback driven, allowing more
than one potential output source. Fixed the -oslog option in the
Windows build. [Nathan Woods]

Fixed "do" command in the debugger. [Aaron Giles]

Had to undo the use of timers to trigger save/restore of states. This
leads to one less timer in the system, and hence will break the save
states from previous versions. The current save state system is
extremely sensitive to such changes, unfortunately. This will be
addressed in a future version. [Aaron Giles]
