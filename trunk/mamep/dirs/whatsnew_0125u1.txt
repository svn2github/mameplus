MAMETesters Bugs Fixed
----------------------
01795: [Misc.] tm, tm3k, tm4k, tm5k, tm7k: Day on clock doesn't work
       (Luigi30)
01717: [DIP/Input] arcadecl, sparkz: Service Key mapped twice. 
       (stephh)
01713: [DIP/Input] spaceg: All joystick/buttons mapped twice. Button 1 
       is mapped 3 times! (stephh)

       Also, there are discrete sound issues. (Fabio Priuli)

       (Roberto Fresca)

       (Roberto Fresca)



Source Changes
--------------
Improved cbombers sprites [Philip Bennett]

Renamed ports and used AM_READ_PORT macros in arcadecl. [stephh]

Add feature to the cia6526: in READ operation the value can be forced 
by a external circuit; this feature is necessary for MESS. [robiza]

undrfire.c improvements: [Philip Bennett]
 * Hooked up cbombers steering wheel input.
 * Changed ES5505 clock rate to 30476100/2.
 * Unified cbombers memory maps and tidied up some code.
 * Removed the undrfire speedup hack.

Marked the sound roms on Q*Bert's Qubes as bad and changed the flag to 
imperfect sound. The current sound cpu roms are the same as on a 
normal Q*Bert board, which is incorrect. At least three sound effects 
are present in the real qq-snd roms but not the Q*Bert qb-snd ones.
[Lord Nightmare]

Fixed the ROZ effect in Namco NA1 driver. ROZ tilemap is actually an 
additional tilemap. Fixes a bug where a "roz enable" test was causing 
a normal layer to be rendered with ROZ effects in-game. There is no 
roz enable register - it's always available for mixing with other 
tilemaps and sprites. This also adds a missing NAMCO logo zoom/spin 
effect in Emeralda's attract mode. [Phil Stroffolino]

Added memory address parameter to CDP1802 DMA callbacks, and added a 
macro for the CPU interface. [Curt Coder]

Rewrote the Gaelco video ram encryption, which finally makes sense.
The key observation was that when decrypting the second word, both 
encrypted and decrypted bits of the first word are used. Many thanks 
to Javier Valero for the detailed information that made this possible.
[Nicola Salmoria]

Fixed coin inputs, added validator input, and added notes on inputs to
the tmaster driver. [Luigi30]

Merged memory maps for drivers: tagteam, tail2nos, tankbatt, tankbust, 
taotaido, targeth, and taxidrvr. [Andrew Gardner]

New driver for old Game-A-Tron gambling games hardware. 
[Roberto Fresca]
 - Properly decoded graphics.
 - Proper memory map.
 - Added NVRAM support.
 - Proper Inputs through 8255 PPI I/O chip.
 - Both games are working.
 - Added technical & game notes.

New universal dynamic recompiler system: [Aaron Giles]

    The central module is drcuml.c, which defines a universal 
    machine language syntax that can be generated by a frontend 
    recompiler and then retargeted via a generic backend 
    interface to any of a number of different architectures. A 
    disassembler for the UML is also included to allow 
    examination of the generated UML code.

    Currently supported backend architectures include 32-bit x86,
    64-bit x86, and a platform-neutral interpreted C backend that
    can be used as a fallback for platforms without native 
    support. The C backend also performs additional validation
    to ensure assumptions are met.

    Along with the new architecture is a new MIPS III/IV 
    recompiler frontend. This frontend has been rewritten from 
    the old x64-specific recompiler to generate UML opcodes
    instead. This means that the single recompiler can be used
    to target multiple backend architectures and should in
    theory produce identical results across all of them.

    The old 32-bit and 64-bit MIPS recompilers are now officially
    retired. The new system provides similar performance (within
    5% generally) to the old system and has similar compatibility.
    The only currently known issues are some problems with the
    two Gauntlet 3D games.

Added DS5002FP CPU core. [Manuel Abadia]

Added CDP1852 I/O buffer chip, and used it in Altair/Draco. 
[Curt Coder]

Found the proper algorithm to decrypt the blue TAB PCB in the funworld
driver. Replaced the old decryption tables with the proper decryption 
scheme. Updated technical notes. [Roberto Fresca]

Added uncompressed AVI recording: [Aaron Giles]

    Extended aviio to be able to write RGB bitmaps. Unfortunately, 
    the only option is fully uncompressed, which means the resulting 
    AVIs are *HUGE* and may not play correctly in realtime due to 
    high data rate. The intention is that these uncompressed AVIs 
    are post-processed by other utilities to compress the video and 
    produce a realtime playable result.

    Added new command-line option -aviwrite which works just like
    -mngwrite, except it produces AVIs and streams sound to them.
    Updated documentation accordingly.

    Shift+F12 still produces MNGs for now, though this might change
    in the future.

    Modified fileio.c to retain the full pathname to the file so
    that it can be queried while the file is open.

Updated TMS5200/5220 documentation and comments. Fixed the chirp table 
implementation in both the 51xx and 52xx chips. [Lord Nightmare]

Fixed default dipswitches on thoop to give more than 1 life.
[David Haywood]

Bug fixes for NamcoNA Hardware: [Phil Stroffolino]
 - support for scanline effect (fixes invisible dolphin in Emeralda 
    attract mode)
 - ROZ implementation no longer breaks Numan Athletics pixmap layer
 - blitter fixes; xday graphics are now correct
 - identified extra communications RAM used by xday (probably to 
    control printer)

Fixed crash in dynax games due to missing MSM6242 device. [Dirk Best]

Changed Black tiger main Z80 clock to 6MHz and sound Z80 clock to 
3.579545MHz as verified on PCB. [Corrado Tomaselli]

Consolidated opbase variables into a structure and rescoped them so
they are hidden for general access. [Atari Ace]
