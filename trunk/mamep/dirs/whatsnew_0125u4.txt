Source Changes
--------------
Made it possible to pass a NULL errorbug to input_port_config_alloc().
Fixes -listxml crashes. [Nathan Woods]

Updated calomega driver with correct dumps. [Roberto Fresca]

Sandii' games improvements: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Switched the color system to RESNET calculations.
 - Hooked the infamous bit7 of Input Port 0x3004 in parallel to DIP 
    switch 1. This allow to use the PAYOUT button to trigger the 
    Super Game instead of STOP 5.
 - Demultiplexed lamps matrix.
 - Added lamps support, but is still imperfect.
 - Updated technical notes.

Discrete sound update: [couriersud]
 * added NODE_RELATIVE(NODE, offset) macro to discrete.h
 * fix asteroid.c, canyon.c, skydiver.c and tank8.c to use this macro 
    instead of adding directly to the node

Fixed duplicate input port bits. 
[Aaron Giles, Nicola Salmoria, David Haywood]

Added simulaton of tecmosys protection. [nuapete]

Improvements to gatron.c: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Renamed the games to "Poker 4-1" and "Pull Tabs"
    as shown in the ROMs stickers.
 - Renamed the ROMs in each set according to their own stickers.
 - Moved the driver into gametron.a group.
 - Added the missing input port C to 8255 PPI I/O chip. Poker41 and 
    pulltabs don't make use of it, but is present in the Test/Setting 
    Mode.
 - Updated technical notes.

Added proper bankswitching to the dealer driver, validating a ROM
previously thought to be bad. [nupete]

Many improvements to the tecmosys video and sound emulation. 
[David Haywood]

Adjusted NamcoNA output rate to match pitch with F/A and Cosmo Gang 
the Puzzle soundtrack CDs. [R. Belmont]

Some Nintendo Minx cpu core updates: [Wilbert Pol]
 - Styling changes
 - Added instruction cycle counts.
 - Added interrupt support.
 - Added HALT support.
 - Fixed INT instruction.
 - Added incomplete support for DIV and MUL instructions.
 - Fixed MOV [#nnnn],BA and MOV [#nnnn],HL instructions.
 - Fixed interrupt handling.
 - Fixed opcodes 45, 4D, 55, 5D, B5, B6, B7, FC, FD, and CF 70-7F
 - Fixed flag results for INC, DEC, AND, OR, and XOR instructions
 
Improvements to ampoker2 driver: [Roberto Fresca]
 - Reworked the input system for Sigma Poker 2000.
 - Promoted Sigma Poker 2000 to 'WORKING' state.
 - Updated technical notes.

Updated the 53c810 SCSI adapter to pass IRQ state with the IRQ 
callback. [R. Belmont]

Remove port_input_read_indexed in favor of the use of proper tags in 
a number of drivers. [Fabio Priuli, couriersud]

Upped max directory size for ST-V/Saturn driver. [R. Belmont]

COP4xx updates: [Curt Coder]
 - Added HALT opcode and halt mode to the COP410
 - Added Microbus support, clock divisor selection, and CKO mode 
    selection to the COP420
 - Changed Thayer's Quest keyboard interface to at least slightly 
    resemble the schematics

Changed suprnova blending implementation a bit. Still not right.
[David Haywood]

Optimised tilemap_draw rowscroll case to avoid overhead when used 
with clip rects smaller than the tilemap. This reduces by an order of 
magnitude the time taken to render the bg in Gunnail stage 5.
[Nicola Salmoria]

PowerPC dynamic recompiler: [Aaron Giles]
 - rewrote PowerPC implementation as a dynamic recompiler on top
    of the universal recompiler engine
 - wrote a front-end to analyze PowerPC code paths and register usage
 - wrote a common shared module with C implementations of tricky
    CPU behaviors
 - added separate CPU types for the variants supported, instead of
    relying on a hidden model enum
 - rewrote the serial port emulation for the 4xx series to be more
    accurate and not rely on separate DMA handlers
 - rewrote the MMU handling to implement a software TLB that faults
    in pages and handles changed bits appropriately
 - implemented emulation of the PowerPC 603's software TLB, which
    allows the model 3 games to run without a hack to disable the MMU

Updated the PowerPC disassembler to share constants with the rest of
the core, and to more aggressively use simplified mnemonics, 
especially for branches. [Aaron Giles]

Universal recompiler:
 - fixed frontend to handle opcode widths different from bus width
 - added several new opcodes:
    * (D)GETFLGS - copies the UML flags to a destination operand
    * FDRNDS - rounds a double precision value to single precision
 - renamed several opcodes:
    * SETC   -> CARRY
    * XTRACT -> ROLAND
    * INSERT -> ROLINS
 - consolidated the following opcodes:
    * LOAD?U -> LOAD
    * LOAD?S -> LOADS
    * STORE? -> STORE
    * READ?U -> READ
    * READ?M -> READM
    * WRITE? -> WRITE
    * WRITM? -> WRITEM
    * SEXT?  -> SEXT
    * FTOI?? -> FTOINT
    * FFRI?  -> FFRINT
    * FFRF?  -> FFRFLT
 - removed some opcodes:
    * FLAGS - can be done with GETFLGS/LOAD4/ROLINS
    * ZEXT - can be achieved with AND
    * READ?S - can be achieved with READ/SEXT
 - updated C, x86, and x64 back-ends to support these opcode changes
 - updated disassembler to support these opcode changes
 
MIPS3 dynamic recompiler: [Aaron Giles]
 - fixed Cause register for bad COP instructions
 - updated to use new/changed opcode forms
 - changed context switch so that it only swaps a single pointer

Konami Hornet changes: [Aaron Giles]
 - updated to new PowerPC configurations
 - updated some memory handlers to be native 8-bit handlers
 - cleaned up JVS implementation to work with new serial code
 - added fast RAM for the work RAM to give a small speed boost

Konami GTI Club changes: [Aaron Giles]
 - updated to new PowerPC configurations
 - updated some memory handlers to be native 8-bit handlers

Konami Viper/ZR107 changes: [Aaron Giles]
 - updated to new PowerPC configurations

Sega Model 3 changes: [Aaron Giles]
 - updated to new PowerPC configurations
 - reimplemented/centralized interrupt handling
 - these games are broken for the moment

Fixed crasher due to some Konami games using 8 layers in
the K056832 implementation, even though it was only written
for 4. [Aaron Giles]

Added fisttp opcode to i386 disassembler. [Aaron Giles]

Verified clock frequencies on Air Raid/Cross Shooter.
[Corrado Tomaselli]

Introduced/updated some include files for files that export functions 
whose apis will need to be changed to handle machine parameters 
(cps1.h, decocrpt.h, ms32.h, pgm.h, fd1089.h, konami1.h). In the case 
of konami.c, renamed the file konami1.c and changed the api and 
callers to only require one function export. Pulled memory_region*() 
calls out of for loops and folded the occasional duplicated call. The 
compiler can't likely infer that the results are constant, so this 
should be a minor performance win as well. [Atari Ace]

Fixed some dips and added correct inputs for wpksocv2, despite still 
missing the correct input for begin the left right movement the game 
is almost playable. [Sonikos]

Updated cheat system: [ShimaPong]
 - Locked search region when malloc fails to allocate gigantic memory
    instead of fatal error. Also locked zero malloc error in case of
    search speed = all memory in 32-bit CPU. And added search region
    range checker to lock a search region with a big risk
 - Fixed a bug that old code is always converted to specified
    separator in enable/disable menu
 - Refined new cheat format.
    * Rewritten cheat format again. newest format is
       ":gamename::type::address::data::extend_data:
        (description:comment)"
       Expanded type field now requires 10 bytes (not 8 bytes) and
       it divides internal cpu (2 bytes) and type (8 bytes) parameters
    * Removed VWrite, VRWrite. The flag of Value Selection is merged
       into expanded type field now.
    * Added CBit (Condition Bit). This checks bit in read data then
       set or clear bit in case of true.
    * Rearranged cheat code viwer based on newest cheat format
 - Fixed unworking Load Old Format option. If you want to load old or
    older format code, set it (default is OFF)
 - Renamed functions/structures based on coding guidlines
    All structures and included parameters are completed
 - Merged resize_*_no_dispose() into resize_*()
 - Removed the hack of search region for SH-2 CPU because required
    region is now set as expected without this hack

Made duplicate input port bits an error now that all the warnings are
fixed. [Aaron Giles]

Added compile-time error if PTR64 is incorrectly set. [Aaron Giles]
